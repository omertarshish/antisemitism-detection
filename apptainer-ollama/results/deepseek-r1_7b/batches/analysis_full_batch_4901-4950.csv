While it mentions the BDS movement and critical language about Israel, there is no direct targeting of Jews or use of antisemitic stereotypes. It addresses broader issues without specific malice directed at Jewish individuals.

The tweet discusses geopolitical issues and international movements but does not employ the rhetoric or actions characteristic of antisemitism, which would involve directed hatred or discrimination against Jews as a group. Therefore, it is not classified as antisemitic under IHRA's standards.",No,"The tweet does not directly use or imply Jewish stereotypes such as those found in classical antisemitism guidelines, particularly guideline 10, which involves false assumptions about non-Israeli Jews' loyalty. Instead, the tweet uses the metaphor of ""Zionazi Apartheid,"" a blend that conflates Zionism with the South African apartheid, but this does not equate to real-world injustices or apply antisemitic stereotypes. The language is more of a political critique rather than an attack on Jewish identity or institutions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes using symbols, images, or negative stereotypes tied to Jewish identity to label or stigmatize groups. The tweet refers to someone still using this slur, which reflects a deeply antisemitic worldview by associating Jews with harmful and discriminatory terms.

This slur associates Jews with Zionism, a movement that has been historically used to target and demean Jewish communities.

Therefore, the tweet is classified as antisemitic under the given criteria.",Yes,"The tweet ""@RaniaKhalek Zionazi terrorists"" is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet employs stereotyping by labeling Rania Khalek as ""Zionazi,"" which aligns with anti-Zionist sentiments. This falls under JDA's definition of antisemitism, specifically in point 7 and 6, where individuals are treated negatively based on their Jewish identity without evidence. The use of the term ""terrorists"" further escalates the antisemitic tone by associating her with hostile actions potentially linked to Zionism. Additionally, it references Israel as a state, touching upon guidelines that suggest treating Jews collectively or through negative stereotypes in relation to state actions.

The tweet is not based on factual evidence but rather on stigmatization and essentializing Rania's identity, which are components of antisemitism under the JDA framework."

Third, it uses a conspiracy-like narrative that associates Jews with atrocities without evidence, reinforcing negative stereotypes. Lastly, it applies a double standard by treating Jews differently from other nations when granted living space. These actions collectively constitute antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs several key elements that align with JDA's guidelines:

1. **Use of Derogatory Terms**: The tweet refers to Israelis as ""Zionazis,"" a derogatory term often used to attack Jews, which is itself antisemitic.

2. **Metaphorical Reference to Genocide**: By equating Palestinians with those who would have gas chambers (as in Holocausts), the tweet uses a metaphor that links Palestinians to a historical event involving genocide, which is a form of antisemitism as defined by JDA.

3. **Denying Human Dignity**: The tweet suggests that Palestinians are not human beings and do not deserve ""Lebensraum"" (""right to live""), directly attacking their fundamental human dignity and violating principles of antisemitism that prohibit discrimination based on being Jewish or denying others' humanity.

4. **Questioning Palestinian Rights**: By implying that only settlers (Jews) should have the right to live, the tweet discriminates against Palestinians and associates them with fewer rights, which is another form of antisemitic behavior as defined in JDA.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Key Elements of Antisemitism According to IHRA:**
   - Expression of hatred towards Jews.
   - Rhetorical and physical expressions directed at Jewish or non-Jewish individuals, institutions.
   - Use of offensive language, stereotypes, or negative character traits.

2. **Analyze the Tweet Content:**
   - The tweet refers to a threat by a man to ""massacre Jews"" named ""zionazis,"" using a term widely considered anti-Semitic in extreme left circles.
   - It mentions an increase in antisemitic incidents without specifying targeting, aligning with antisemitism as a trend.

3. **Apply IHRA Definition:**
   - The use of the derogatory term and the threat directly target Jews, fulfilling the criteria for antisemitism.
   - The tweet reflects broader antisemitic trends, supporting its classification under IHRA's definition.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The tweet uses harmful language and references a trend consistent with antisemitism, making it an example of antisemitic behavior according to the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs the term ""zionazis,"" which could be interpreted as a derogatory label applied to Jewish people. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes the use of symbols, images, and stereotypes that link Jews to negative traits or forces. The context suggests that this term is part of an antisemitic campaign, given its association with the extreme left and the increase in reported incidents. Therefore, the tweet adheres to the JDA's definition of antisemitism by utilizing a label that stigmatizes Jewish people as individuals to be targeted or opposed."

While ""Zionazism"" can be a derogatory term related to Zionism, it is not specifically targeting Jews. The tweet uses this term in reference to a non-Jewish individual, Rachel Riley, and does not align with any of the JDA's guidelines for antisemitic behavior, which focuses on discrimination or prejudice directed at Jews themselves rather than broader political stances."

Therefore, under the IHRA definition, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory terms like ""Zionazi"" which associates the Israeli government with negative stereotypes linked to antisemitism. It also frames the US enabling an Israeli government and supporting unspecified laws as part of a broader conspiracy, drawing parallels to anti-Semitic narratives such as those involving hidden agendas or forces of evil. These elements align with classical antisemitic tropes outlined in JDA guidelines, particularly regarding the use of symbols, negative stereotypes, and the perception of conspiracy theories tied to Jewish groups. Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

The word ""Zionism"" is often associated with Jewish people, particularly in a historical context linked to Israel. By using ""Zionazi,"" it could imply that this terrorism is linked to Jews, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes. This language reinforces negative associations between Jews and terrorism, potentially contributing to harmful bias against the Jewish community.

1. **Essentializing and Generalization (Guideline 2)**:
   - Terms like ""big nosed"" and ""Zionist"" are used as broad generalizations about Jews, stereotyping them without basis in individual or collective traits.
   - This aligns with guideline 2, which prohibits essentializing individuals based on race or ethnicity.

2. **Coded Language (Guideline 3)**:
   - The use of hashtags such as ""#Zionism"" implies a negative connotation towards Jews, fitting the coded language described in guideline 3.
   - This coded reference is part of a broader narrative that could be interpreted as denying individual rights and generalizing about the group.

3. **Link to Forces of Evil (Guideline 2)**:
   - The tweet associates Jews with traits like child killers and organ harvesters, reinforcing harmful stereotypes often linked to antisemitism.
   - This aligns with guideline 2's definition where Jews are erroneously linked to forces considered evil or malevolent.

4. **Lack of Contextual Justification**:
   - The tweet does not provide specific evidence or context to justify the negative attributes assigned to Jews, which is a characteristic of antisemitic speech (guideline 1).

The IHRA defines antisemitism as involving hatred directed at Jews, whether expressed through speech, writing, actions, or visual forms, and employing negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories. This tweet does not fall into those categories; instead, it uses general language to criticize individuals who support political figures rather than targeting or making statements about Jews.

3. **Religious Reference**: Referring to individuals as having signed their Bible reinforces stereotypes about Jews or religion in a negative light.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the tweet provided is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). First, I'll read through the JDA guidelines and then analyze the tweet.

The tweet says that someone sent an email complaining about a Zionazi Synagogue in Vancouver supporting Israel and funding it. They referred to it as ""Satan"" in parentheses, which might be hyperbole or slang for something else, but the main issue is the mention of supporting Israel and funding it.

Looking at JDA guidelines, antisemitism includes making statements that imply Jews are linked to evil ( guideline 2), using symbols like synagogues against Jews (guideline 6), treating Jews as agents of a negative force (guideline 7), requiring Jews to condemn actions (guideline 8), or assuming Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries (guideline 9). Also, denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist (guideline 10) can be antisemitic.

The tweet refers to a synagogue supporting Israel and mentions ""Satan"" as the source. The use of ""Zionazi"" might imply anti-Jewish conspiracy, which is harmful. Treating their support for Israel as positive could be seen as implying that Jews are involved in negative actions like funding such organizations (guideline 7). Also, referring to them as ""Satan"" could be a coded message, which is against the guidelines.

Moreover, the tweet supports Israel's actions, which aligns with guidelines 12-14 where supporting state actions isn't inherently antisemitic. However, the overall tone and content, especially the mention of a synagogue being ""Zionazi,"" crosses into antisemitism by associating Jews with negative entities.

So, yes, I think this tweet is antisemitic because it uses coded language and associations that are harmful to Jews.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet exhibits elements of antisemitism according to the JDA guidelines. Here's why:

1. **Coded Language**: The term ""Zionazi"" in parentheses suggests a negative connotation towards Jews, potentially implying a hidden anti-Semitic conspiracy.

2. **Affirmative Support**: The tweet supports Israel and funding its organizations without critiquing their actions in an antisemitic light, which goes against guidelines that advise against supporting such actions.

3. **Negative Stereotypes**: Using ""Satan"" as a descriptor for the synagogue implies anti-Semitic stereotypes by equating Jews with negative forces.

The combination of these elements makes the tweet harmful and consistent with antisemitic definitions."

It also associates Lammy with apartheid Israel Zionism, which aligns with historical and current antisemitic ideologies. These elements together constitute antisemitic statements as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet in question employs several elements that could be considered problematic under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentialization**: The tweet refers to someone as an ""anti semite,"" which is a stereotype and form of essentialization, often used to generalize traits about Jews.

2. **Conflation with Apartheid and Zionism**: By associating the mention of apartheid with Israeli policies (as in ""israel zionazis""), the tweet draws a problematic analogy between South Africa's apartheid regime and Jewish people or their supporters. This conflation equates a historical human rights issue with anti-Semitic associations.

3. **Stereotyping and Labeling**: The use of the term ""anti semite"" to describe David Lammy is likely meant as a stereotype, which falls under the JDA's guidelines against treating populations with inherent traits without justification.

4. **Misrepresentation of Zionism**: The tweet's use of ""zionazis"" might imply that supporting Israel is part of a broader anti-Semitic narrative, conflating Jewish identity with political support for israeli policies that are not inherently antisemitic but can be misused to stigmatize Jews.

In summary, the tweet combines essentializing language and problematic connotations about anti-Semitism through its associations between apartheid and Jewish people or supporters, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This directly violates JDA's definition, as it essentializes or reduces Palestinians to a stereotypical category based on their ethnicity.

2. **BDS and Stigma**: The tweet uses the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement hashtags, which is a well-known antisemitic tool used to isolate Jewish businesses and organizations. This tactic of stigmatizing entire communities rather than addressing specific grievances is consistent with JDA's guidelines.

3. **Personal Attack and Stigma**: The tweet implies that the Palestinian individual, Abdullah Abu Nasr, is responsible for his own actions (being ""curious"") on his land in a way that reflects antisemitic prejudice. It also uses language like ""Murder"" to further personalize the attack and spread harmful stereotypes.

4. **Anti-Palestinian Stigma**: The use of hashtags like #GroupPalestine, #BDS, and others associated with Palestinian political movements reinforces a pattern of spreading BDS and anti-Palestinianism, which is a form of antisemitic rhetoric that marginalizes and discriminates against Palestinians.

It uses the term ""ZioNazis,"" which is a derogatory slur for Jews, and references content from ""The ugly truth,"" a Nazi propaganda publication. These actions constitute a hostile perception of Jews, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as it involves direct and harmful speech and association with Nazi content.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs the term ""ZioNazis,"" which is a coded reference to neo-Nazi ideologies that have historical roots in anti-Semitic propaganda. This usage aligns with guideline 2, where antisemitism involves associating Jews with forces of evil or conspiracies aimed at dehumanizing them. Additionally, sharing articles from ""The ugly truth"" further supports this classification as it spreads harmful and discriminatory content. Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA."

Any ?’s- #TBT",Yes,"The tweet employs antisemitic content by using derogatory terms like ""ZioNazi"" which is a negative stereotype associated with Jewish people. Although not explicitly targeting Jews, the use of this term and references to anti-Semitic figures like S. Adelson suggest a broader Hundertmark syndrome approach, which implies hatred towards an entire group based on their identity. This aligns with the IHRA's definition as it involves expressing hatred toward Jews through negative stereotypes or references.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses derogatory terms such as ""ZioNazi"" to label Adelson, a known Zionist, which Essentializes Jewish identity. Additionally, it references ""Apartheid,"" historically linked to South Africa's oppressive regime, and employs harmful imagery like ""cancerous."" These elements align with antisemitic criteria by promoting stereotypes and supporting narratives that equate Jews with negative traits or forces of harm."

This constitutes the use of antisemitic stereotypes and negative character traits as per IHRA's definition. Additionally, the mention of Zionism could be interpreted as associating individuals or groups with Jewish ideology negatively.",No,"The tweet ""@AviMayer @saint_91 @IlhanMN @bungarsargon ZioNazi pig 🐷"" does not appear to be antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While ""Zion Nazi"" could have historical connotations related to anti-Semitic ideologies, such as referencing the Nazi-Zionist alliance, there is no clear evidence that this tweet expresses any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews. The mention of IlhanMN is neutral and unrelated to antisemitic content. Without context indicating broader negative intentions or references, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."
1096773444971184128,LivingBeeHive,2019-02-16 14:09:01+00:00,1,ZioNazi,@DaysofPalestine Zionazis criminals,Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it associates DaysofPalestine, a Palestinian collective known for promoting Palestinian culture and resistance through art, with Zionism. This links the Palestinian group to Jewish ideology or actions without acknowledging their contributions or context, thus perpetuating a negative stereotype about Jews through the use of the term ""Zionazis"" (critics of Zionism) and labeling them as criminals.

The tweet is problematic as it employs a harmful stereotype that associates a Palestinian collective with antisemitic ideologies, potentially contributing to antisemitism by reinforcing negative perceptions of Jews.",Yes,"The tweet ""@DaysofPalestine Zionazis criminals"" is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The term ""Zionazis"" used in the tweet reinforces negative stereotypes about Zionism, which ties Jewish identity to criminal activity. This aligns with JDA guidelines that address treating Jews as agents of a state or associating them with negative traits and conspiracies. The use of such language perpetuates antisemitic tropes by implying that Jews are involved in criminal activities, thereby contributing to the classification of this tweet as antisemitic."

While anti-Zionism is a form of antisemitism, this tweet specifically attacks an ethnic group within the broader Israeli community and does not align with the specific criteria for antisemitism directed toward Jews or their communities.",No,"The tweet does not meet any of the criteria outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It addresses the actions and claims of Israel-Palestine without targeting Jews as a specific group, using hashtags related to Palestinian rights and the BDS movement rather than antisemitic symbols or stereotypes. The content focuses on political criticism of Israeli actions and does not engage in essentialization or use coded language characteristic of antisemitism."
