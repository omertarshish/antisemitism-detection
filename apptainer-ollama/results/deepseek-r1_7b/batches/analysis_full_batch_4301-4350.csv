This parallels classic antisemitism, where Jews are stereotyped or essentialized for negative traits associated with past events (like being criminals).

Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. The tweet says, ""This is how it works. Always has. It‚Äôs how Hitler whipped up hatred of the Jews. It‚Äôs dehumanising. It‚Äôs very dangerous."" 

First, let me recall the IHRA definition provided: Antisemitism involves a perception or expression of hatred towards Jews, directed against individuals or groups and their property, institutions, etc. They also mention examples like targeting Israel as a collective, making broad generalizations about Jews, and using specific symbols or stereotypes.

Looking at the tweet, it's comparing current hatred of Jews to the actions of Hitler. It says ""It‚Äôs how Hitler whipped up hatred,"" which seems to be a historical reference to justify current antisemitism by linking it to Nazi Germany's actions. The tweet also mentions dehumanizing and dangerous, which aligns with harmful stereotypes.

I should consider whether this is a stereotypical or generalizable claim about Jews. It does seem like the speaker is using a historical context (Hitler) to make a broad statement about Jews today, which could be seen as a stereotype or simplification that marginalizes other Jewish people who aren't associated with the Nazis but are still victims of antisemitism.

Additionally, it's making a direct accusation without evidence against all Jews, implying that all Jews are responsible for historical hatred. This kind of broad generalization can perpetuate antisemitism by ignoring the diversity within the Jewish community and focusing on a negative stereotype linked to a historical event.

The tweet also uses dehumanizing language like ""dehumanising,"" which is one of the criteria for antisemitic speech as per IHRA. It's not targeting specific individuals but rather the entire group, using it as a collective label to justify or perpetuate hatred.

So putting this all together: The tweet generalizes historical actions (Hitler) against Jews to justify current hatred, uses dehumanizing language, and makes broad accusations without considering individual cases. These elements align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it employs stereotypical language by drawing a historical parallel between Nazi Germany's actions and current hatred towards Jews. It uses dehumanizing terms like ""dehumanising"" and generalizes against an entire group without considering individual contexts, which aligns with antisemitic expressions as defined.

The tweet references Hitler to justify contemporary hatred of Jews, implying that all Jews are responsible for historical atrocities. This broad generalization perpetuates stereotypes and ignores the diversity within the Jewish community. Additionally, it uses dehumanizing language, which is a key component of antisemitic speech according to IHRA.

In summary, the tweet falls under antisemitism due to its stereotypical claims, dehumanizing language, and broad accusations without considering individual cases or evidence about all Jews.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It mentions how Hitler whipped up hatred against Jews, which aligns with guideline 2 of part B. Additionally, it uses dehumanizing language that equates Jews with negative traits, fitting under example 6 and 9. The reference to historical anti-Semitism further supports its classification as antisemitic."

While it suggests that Jews are responsible for global domination, this is more of a general statement about Jews rather than targeting them specifically as a group.

However, without explicit or contextual reference to Jews, it does not directly meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA's definition provided in section B.6.

The reasoning is based on the understanding that the tweet avoids specific mention of ""Jewish"" while using generalizable language about Jews as threats. This aligns more with the spirit of non-antisemitic statements outlined in sections C.13 and C.14, which emphasize context-dependent criticism rather than broad, generalized statements."

Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition provided.

First, let me read the tweet carefully. It mentions that on August 27, 1943, a transport of 205 Jews were deported from a slave labor camp in Eberswalde and arrived at Auschwitz. All were later murdered in a gas chamber after selection. 

Looking at the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred toward Jews, both expressed as rhetoric or physically directed at Jewish individuals or property. It also mentions that it can include actions targeting a state perceived as a collective of Jews, like Israel.

In this tweet, the focus is on a group of Jews deported and murdered. The tweet accurately describes an event from history involving Jews in a slave labor camp leading to their deportation and murder. There's no overtly hateful language or demonization towards Jews; it's a factual account of a historical event.

However, I should consider if the IHRA definition includes such events as antisemitic. The tweet doesn't present this as a criticism of Israel but rather describes a specific event in history where Jews were targeted and eliminated. There's no mention of Israel being portrayed negatively or implying a broader conspiracy or control over other groups.

Since the tweet accurately reports an event without any ideological slant or demonization, it might not meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as defined because it doesn't exhibit the traits listed‚Äîlike hatred, rhetoric, physical actions towards Jewish individuals, or association with anti-Semitic stereotypes.

DECISION: No

The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. It is a factual account of a historical event where 205 Jews were deported and later murdered in a gas chamber after arriving at Auschwitz. There are no overtly hateful or demagogic elements, nor does it fit within the categories outlined for antisemitism such as hate speech, demonization, or association with anti-Semitic stereotypes.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** The IHRA defines antisemitism as a hostile perception directed at Jews through speech, symbols, action, etc., often involving negative stereotypes or accusations.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet:** The tweet discusses symbolic practices (Sabbath and circumcision) without targeting Jewish individuals or communities. It does not use any negative stereotypes about Jews or invoke historical conspiracies against them.

3. **Comparison to IHRA Criteria:**
   - Does it involve hatred, stereotyping, or conspiracy theories? No.
   - Is it a form of discrimination based on identity? Not specifically towards Jewish people.
   - Does it reference antisemitic ideologies? No; it's about cultural symbolism.

4. **Conclusion:** The tweet does not meet the IHRA criteria for antisemitism as it doesn't target or stereotype Jews and avoids discussing historical conspiracies against them.

**Answer:** The tweet is not antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it doesn't involve any form of hostile perception, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories targeting Jewish people.",No,"The tweet in question draws a comparison between the treatment of Jewish customs (circumcision) and how others have treated the Sabbath. However, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, or hostility against Jews as Jews. The tweet does not essentialize Jews, link them to evil, use negative stereotypes, make generalizations, or require Jews to condemn actions. It is a metaphorical comparison of religious practices without any overtly antisemitic content. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

2. **Coded Language and scapegoating**: Using terms like ""Land 3XN"" and refusing to provide refugee status or teach hate towards non-Jewish groups is a form of antisemitic trope where a broader group is stigmatized for the actions of a smaller subgroup, without acknowledging their own complicity.

3. **Implied Denial of Rights**: By stating that Jews don't deserve refugee status or aren't taught hate, it reinforces negative stereotypes about Jewish people and their treatment within Arab countries.

The mention of converting ""Newish Jews"" and naming the podcast ""Jewish News"" for them might imply a reductionist view of Jewish identity, which could be problematic. This targeting based on Jewish heritage without positive framing could be interpreted as promoting anti-Semitism.

Therefore, while the initial assessment leans towards not being antisemitic due to the possibility of constructive intentions, there are nuances that suggest it may cross into antisemitism by reducing a community for conversion purposes. 

But considering the broader context and the potential for educational intent, the tweet might be seen as neutral or not inherently harmful, thus falling outside the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

The context in which the tweet was made could be interpreted as part of a larger conversation or critique towards Rashida Tlaib, but without evidence that it represents a widespread view or systematic discrimination against all Jews, it may not meet the criteria for antisemitism defined by the JDA.

However, upon further reflection, given that Rashida Tlaib is a Palestinian Authority figure and the tweet contains harmful language directed at Jews, there could be an implicit link to Palestinian stereotypes. Therefore, considering this context, the tweet might be interpreted as contributing to antisemitism, albeit indirectly through its content and directed towards a Palestinian Authority official.

Taking into account the possibility of misinterpretation based on context, it is prudent to conclude that the tweet may contribute to antisemitic sentiments, especially if viewed within a framework that interprets such statements towards public figures as part of broader antisemitic narratives. 

But strictly speaking, without evidence of systematic discrimination against Jews or widespread harm done by Jews, and given that the tweet was directed at Rashida Tlaib rather than as an overtly antisemitic statement about all Jews, it may not fully meet the JDA criteria.

They could not forgive us for kicking their asses in WW1. Bosnian muslims meanwhile : https://t.co/5K4IZAewmT",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by breaking down the tweet and analyzing each part.

The tweet mentions targeting Jews in Serbia for killing, along with Serbs. It also brings up a comparison with World War I, specifically mentioning that NaziÂæ∑ÂõΩ could not forgive them for kicking their asses. Then it shifts focus to Bosnian Muslims, noting they were treated differently under Nazi Germany.

First, I'll check the IHRA definition: Antisemitism is any perception of Jews as hateful, whether expressed as hatred or discrimination towards individuals, communities, institutions, etc., and it can be verbal, physical, or symbolic. It often involves negative stereotypes or charges aimed at blaming Jews for societal issues.

Looking at the tweet, the author mentions ""Nacisti"" (which means Nazis) trying to kill Jews in Serbia and also Serbs. This could imply that both Serbs and Jews are targets of antisemitic actions. However, the term ""Nazi"" is used without targeting Jews specifically but rather implying a broader anti-Semitic sentiment.

The tweet also includes a historical comparison with World War I, suggesting that justification for atrocities against Serbs was given by Nazi Germany after WWI, which involves antisemitism in their ideology. The mention of Bosnian Muslims being treated differently under Nazi Germany adds another layer, implying that Jews are not the only ones suffering from such treatment.

But wait, the tweet is about targeting both Jews and Serbs with Nastis (Nazi) actions. However, IHRA's definition requires antisemitism to be directed specifically towards Jewish individuals or communities. The tweet doesn't explicitly name Jews as the target but rather uses a general term that could imply targeting of Jewish people along with others.

Moreover, the mention of Bosnian Muslims suggests that the author is aware of historical antisemitic treatment by Nazi Germany and is using it to compare their own actions against. This might be an attempt to justify targeting Jews by drawing parallels with past atrocities.

But according to IHRA's working definition, if the tweet implies hatred or discrimination towards Jewish individuals in Serbia, even alongside targeting Serbs, that could constitute antisemitism because it involves a negative perception of Jews as a group.

However, I need to consider if the tweet is specifically targeting Jews. The use of ""Nacisti"" and implying they are responsible for killing Serbs (which includes Jews) might be conflating actions against both groups. If the intention was to target Jews specifically without explicitly stating it, that could still count as antisemitism.

Alternatively, since the tweet also mentions Bosnian Muslims being treated differently by Nastis, it's possible that the author is equating their own actions (against Serbs) with historical Nazi actions against Jews and Muslims. This might be an attempt to justify targeting Jews by comparing it to past atrocities, which could be a form of antisemitism.

But I'm not entirely sure if conflating the treatment of different groups under the same label counts as antisemitism. The IHRA definition focuses on directed toward Jewish individuals or communities. So if the tweet's intent is to target Jews in Serbia specifically without targeting Serbs as a separate group, then it might be more clearly antisemitic.

However, since the tweet also mentions targeting Serbs and uses the same term ""Nacisti"" which could imply that both are being targeted for similar actions, I'm leaning towards it not being strictly antisemitic because it's not specifically targeting Jews but rather implying a broader anti-Semitic sentiment towards certain groups without explicitly singling out Jews.

Wait, no. The tweet says Nastis tried to kill as many Jews as they could find in Serbia and also Serbs. So the action is against both Jews and Serbs, which suggests that the author views both groups as targets of antisemitic actions. But IHRA's definition requires targeting towards Jewish individuals or communities specifically.

So if the tweet implies hatred toward both Jews and Serbs without explicitly targeting Jews, then it might not meet the specific criteria because it doesn't directly target Jewish people but rather a broader group that includes them.

Additionally, the mention of Bosnian Muslims being treated differently by Nastis adds another layer. If the author is implying that Nastis were justified in their actions against Serbs and Jews but not towards Muslims, then it could be stretching the definition to justify targeting Jews based on historical precedents.

But I'm still unsure because the tweet doesn't explicitly name Jews as the target; instead, it's a general statement about Nastis being responsible for killing people regardless of whether they are Serbs or Jews. However, if antisemitism involves targeting specific groups like Jews, then conflating actions against different ethnicities might not be sufficient.

Alternatively, if the tweet is using ""Nastis"" as a label that includes Jews because they were targeted in historical events, it could be seen as implying that Nastis' actions were directed specifically at Jews and Muslims. But without explicit targeting of Jews, I'm not sure if that counts.

Wait, no, the tweet says Nastis tried to kill as many Jews as possible in Serbia, including Serbs. So the author is saying that Nastis targeted both Serbs and Jews. This might imply that both groups were victims or targets under Nastis' actions, but it's not clear if the author is targeting Jews specifically.

If the tweet is using ""Nastis"" as a broad label implying general anti-Semitic actions without singling out Jews, then perhaps it doesn't meet the criteria because antisemitism should be directed towards Jewish individuals or communities.

However, considering that Nastis refers to both Serbs and Jews being targeted, but IHRA's definition requires targeting towards specific Jewish people. Therefore, unless the tweet explicitly targets Jews, it might not be considered antisemitic under IHRA.

Wait, no. The tweet mentions Nastis trying to kill as many Jews as possible in Serbia, including Serbs. So if ""Nastis"" includes both, but it's more about general anti-Semite actions targeting all people regardless of being Jewish or Serbian, then maybe it doesn't specifically target Jews.

But actually, the tweet implies that Nastis were responsible for killing Jews and Serbs, which could be seen as a broader anti-Semitic act where Jews are included in the target group. So if the intent is to imply that Nastis were targeting Jews (as well as Serbs), then it would meet the criteria because it's directed towards Jewish individuals.

Therefore, I think the tweet does involve antisemitism because it implies hatred or discrimination against Jewish people along with Serbs under the guise of Nastis' actions. Therefore, it meets the IHRA definition by targeting specific Jewish communities.
</think>

The tweet in question touches on historical contexts and uses broad terms to imply a general anti-Semitic sentiment towards certain groups without explicitly singling out Jewish individuals as the primary target. However, upon closer examination:

1. **Targeting of Groups**: The tweet mentions that Nastis (Nazi) tried to kill as many Jews as possible in Serbia, including Serbs. This implies a broader context where both Serbs and Jews are targeted under the same label.

2. **Historical Context**: By drawing parallels with historical events where Nastis justified their actions against Serbs but not necessarily towards Jews or Muslims, the tweet attempts to justify targeting Jews based on past precedents.

3. **IHRA Definition**: The International Human Rights Academy (IHRA) defines antisemitism as directed specifically towards Jewish individuals or communities. The tweet's implication that Nastis targeted both Serbs and Jews suggests a broader anti-Semitic sentiment where Jews are included in the group being targeted.

4. **Conclusion**: While the tweet does not explicitly name Jews as the target, the context and implications suggest a form of antisemitism by targeting Jewish individuals along with others under the guise of historical justification.

**Final Answer**: Yes, the tweet involves antisemitism as it implies hatred or discrimination towards Jewish people in Serbia through the broader context of Nastis' actions.",No,"The tweet contains elements that could be interpreted as implying antisemitism. It uses terms like ""Nacisti"" which might carry connotations of anti-Semitic ideologies and suggests a pattern of targeting Jews alongside other groups without a basis in Jewish identity alone. However, it's important to note that without clear evidence or context indicating systematic discrimination based on Jewish ethnicity, the classification may be subjective."

However, it refers to others as ""Jews"" in a general sense when discussing support for hate speech aimed at their financial gain. While the user expresses a dislike for people who bring hatred based on Jewish heritage without specifying individuals or groups, this could be interpreted as a form of antisemitism by implying a negative stereotype about Jews as a collective group. The tweet's use of terms like ""Jews"" in reference to @built2win3 and others suggests a general perception that may align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism through rhetoric directed toward Jewish individuals or groups without specific targeting.

However, it is important to note that the tweet does not explicitly state any antisemitic ideologies or actions but instead critiques people who bring hatred based on financial gain. The use of ""Jews"" in a collective sense could be seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes about Jews rather than direct antisemitic acts.

In conclusion, while the tweet touches on themes related to antisemitism through its references and general statements, it does not meet the specific criteria for an antisemitic act or expression under the IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits clear antisemitic characteristics under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It essentializes Jews by associating them with behavior that brings financial gain while being manipulative, suggesting they are inherently evil. Additionally, it opposes hate directed at Jews, aligning with JDA's guidelines 1, 2, and 3.

The tweet references statements like ""I don't hope real Jews die"" which implies a discriminatory attitude towards Jewish individuals or communities. The use of the word ""Jews"" to describe people who bring hate for financial gain further ties into the belief in Jews being linked to forces of evil ( guideline 2). 

Furthermore, the tweet's claim that ""You are pretending to be God by this whole crap of I‚Äôm not going to heaven"" and dismissing others' opinions without considering their validity can be interpreted as a coded or indirect form of discrimination against Jewish people. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as involving discrimination, prejudice, or hostility directed at Jews. 

In summary, the tweet meets multiple criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA, including essentialization, association of Jews with negative traits, and manipulation through coded language."

This approach oversimplifies ethnicity and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, aligning with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves dehumanizing language targeting Jewish people based on perceived characteristics without evidence. Additionally, the tweet uses conspiracy-like rhetoric that can be used to spread hatred and discrimination against Jews, reinforcing antisemitic perceptions. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet begins by acknowledging that ""race is socially constructed,"" which is a neutral statement as it pertains to a broader societal understanding of race. However, the second part of the tweet states, ""Jews can‚Äôt be white because of their levantine DNA."" This implies that having certain genetic traits associated with the Levant region (levantine DNA) disqualifies someone from being white if they identify as Jewish. 

According to JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination and prejudice against Jews based on race, religion, ethnicity, etc., without exception for Jewish people. The tweet's use of genetic markers to generalize about Jewish identity could perpetuate harmful stereotypes by associating physical traits with ethnicity in a way that can stigmatize non-Jews who may share those characteristics. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves making generalizations or associations that can lead to discrimination against Jewish individuals based on their perceived race or genetic background."

Jesus was Palestinian and the Palestinians k!lled him.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. 

1. **Denial of Jewish Existence**: The tweet starts by questioning ""Jews never existed,"" which directly denies their existence and perpetuates a harmful stereotype, akin to accusing them of not being part of the human community.

2. **False Claims About Jewish Individuals**: By stating that Jesus was Palestinian, it misrepresents Jewish heritage, falsely associating Jews with negative historical events (the Holocaust) and actions like Jesus's supposed killing.

3. **Scapegoating and Stereotyping**: The use of harsh language such as ""k!lled him"" associates Jews with negative stereotypes and conspiracies, contributing to antisemitism by demonizing the community.

These actions collectively challenge the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes attacking Jewish communities' existence, perpetuating harmful stereotypes, and using language that demonizes them. Therefore, this tweet is classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet from Margie employs antisemitic elements by associating the existence of Jesus with Palestinians and thereby denying the existence of Jews, which challenges the validity of their identity.

The tweet is more about valuing group perspectives rather than addressing or rejecting harmful stereotypes related to antisemitism.

The tweet does not engage with any specific examples from the JDA's definition, such as hate speech, discriminatory words, imagery, or deeds that would constitute antisemitism.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** The tweet does not reference any antisemitic themes such as discrimination, stereotypes, or associations targeting Jews.

2. **Content Analysis:** There is no mention of Jewish people being hostile, targeted, or associated with harmful actions (like posting a Hitler meme). Instead, it seems to be about personal opinions on the attack and labeling Black people.

3. **Relevance to JDA:** The JDA focuses on discrimination against Jewish groups in general, but this tweet does not target Jewish individuals or align with any of its guidelines regarding antisemitism.

4. **Conclusion:** Since none of the JDA's criteria for antisemitism are met, and the content appears innocent, the tweet is not considered antisemitic under the given definition."
