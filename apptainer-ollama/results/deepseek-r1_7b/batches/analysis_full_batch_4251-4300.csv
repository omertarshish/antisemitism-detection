My grandfather bought a home in the old city &amp; by 1940  had to leave due to the constant attacks by the Arabs. Read that again...this was pre Israel's establishment. A thread 🧵,No,"The tweet discusses historical events involving Arab attacks on Jews in Jerusalem before Israel was established. However, it does not exhibit any form of antisemitic behavior as defined by the IHRA. It is factual and does not contain any discriminatory language or targeted expressions against Jews. The content focuses on personal experiences with historical context rather than making broad statements or using stereotypes that would constitute antisemitism.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. It recountsa factual account of historical events involving a family's experience in pre-Israels period, without any discriminative language or negative stereotypes directed at Jews. There are no instances where Jews are equated with harmful forces, nor does it critique Zionism. The tweet adheres to the principles outlined in JDA guidelines by avoiding antisemitic content and focusing on factual descriptions of events."

Jesus went into detail elaborating why God was permissive about marriage towards the Jews but made it clear that God's design is for one man and one wife.,No,"The tweet discusses general religious beliefs without targeting specific Jewish individuals, communities, or their properties. It references Bible verses but does not express hatred towards Jews as a group or promote antisemitic stereotypes or actions.

The IHRA definition of antisemitism involves targeting Jewish people, either directly or through negative perceptions and symbols. Here, the tweet focuses on religious practices without such specific targeting. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the JDA definition because it is making a general statement about Christian teachings on marriage and polygamy, referencing Jesus' teachings on marriage without implying any form of discrimination or generalization against all Jews. Antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, or hostility against Jews as an entire group, but this tweet does not target or generalize in that way. Instead, it is a broader commentary on religious principles related to marriage and polygamy."

A leaflet distributed at a Lab Conference about the Holocaust that doesn't mention Jews\n3. That #ItWasAScam blames Jews for election defeats.\n\nQuite a CV there, David.",Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. 

1. **Generalized Hate Perceptions**: The tweet suggests that 29% of Lab members believe the world is run by Jews, which is a harmful generalization about Jews influencing global affairs.

2. **Exclusion and Demonization**: The mention of a leaflet distributed at a Lab Conference about the Holocaust without mentioning Jews perpetuates exclusionary stereotypes, positioning Jews negatively in historical contexts.

3. **Scapegoating**: By linking Jewish people to election defeats through #ItWasAScam, the tweet uses antisemitic language to assign blame to Jews for societal issues.

These points collectively demonstrate harmful generalizations and perceptions about Jews, fitting within the IHRA's framework of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not directly reference or imply antisemitic content regarding the State of Israel and Palestine. While it makes broad statements about surveys that could be misinterpreted, there is no explicit mention or promotion of harmful stereotypes or group blame without context that would align with JDA's guidelines against antisemitism in this context.

The analysis considered each point in the tweet but found that none of them directly address or reference Israel and Palestine in a way that would violate the specific guidelines outlined. The concern might be with broader antisemitic narratives, but since those are not explicitly stated here, they do not constitute a determination of antisemitism under JDA's definition.

Thus, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, this tweet is not antisemitic."
1454414948105433095,OgbeniDemola,2021-10-30 11:48:40+00:00,0,Jews,Igbos that call themselves Jews are miseducated. Jews have debunked this stupid thing these guys are saying. \n\nIt’s mental slavery that will make you want to be everyone else but yourself.,No,"The tweet is not antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it does not meet the criteria of targeting individuals perceived as Jewish in a way that marginalizes or discriminates against other Jewish identities. While it uses the term ""Jew"" which could be problematic, it does not explicitly target specific Jewish communities beyond the Igbos group mentioned. The statements do not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or exclude other Jewish groups, thus avoiding antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

**Note:** The initial response provided a detailed analysis but incorrectly decided ""No,"" while the correct assessment is that it may still be considered antisemitic due to conflating race with Jewish identity. However, upon reconsideration, if the tweet does not explicitly target other Jewish groups beyond Igbos and uses ""Jew"" in a way that could be seen as exclusionary without broader harm, it might not fully meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet employs essentialization by referring to Igbos as ""Jews,"" thereby reducing them to a characteristic that may not align with their actual identity. This practice of stereotype-making and discrimination against an entire group fits within the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which involves treating Jews (or Jewish institutions) based on their inherent qualities without considering their true identities or backgrounds. The tweet also perpetuates harmful stereotypes by implying that calling Igbos ""Jews"" is incorrect, contributing to antisemitic ideologies."

While the user does not explicitly perpetuate antisemitism in real-time, their comment aligns with historical antisemitic narratives, which could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews.

However, according to IHRA's definition, referencing historical targeting of Jews without context might be interpreted as contributing to or supporting antisemitic views. Therefore, this tweet does not fit the IHRA's criteria for non-antisemitic statements.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism as it essentializes Jews by associating them with capitalism and targeting them due to this stereotype. Essentializing a group by treating them as inherently or essentially a particular trait (here, capitalists) without context is a key antisemitic act. Additionally, the conflation of anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews with historical events related to Nazi Germany further solidifies its antisemitic nature according to JDA guidelines."

It equates behavior associated with Nazi Germany (crowd control tactics) to Jews, using such negative connotations. Additionally, it associates the Rothschild family with antisemitic conspiracies, potentially leveraging stereotypes about a specific Jewish business dynasty without basis. These actions align with IHRA's criteria for antisemitism by targeting Jews collectively and using dehumanizing language based on their Jewish identity.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs several elements outlined in the definition. Firstly, it uses classic antisemitic stereotypes by comparing individuals' actions and conspiracies to Jews from Nazi Germany, a common form of historical stereotyping that JDA deems problematic. This comparison is part of section 2 of the guidelines, which warns against essentializing groups based on shared historical associations with perceived enemies.

Secondly, the tweet assumes that non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries due to their Jewish identity (section 9). This assumption is reminiscent of antisemitic biases where ethnicity is used to judge loyalty or behavior without evidence.

Additionally, the mention of ""Jews in Nazi Germany"" directly invokes historical antisemitism by linking Jews to persecution and evil, as outlined in section 2. The tweet's language is charged with connotations that could incite hatred, aligning with section 5, which warns against denying or minimizing the Holocaust.

Lastly, the use of coded statements about economic power through the Rothschild family ties into section 4, where such coded messages can be problematic when used to stigmatize a group. Overall, the tweet's combination of stereotyping and historical associations makes it highly antisemitic according to JDA guidelines."

Meanwhile, the organization leans on doubtful Arabic-language sources, including a propaganda account linked to pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. https://t.co/X4wwBPrsE1",Yes,"The tweet from HRW can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It attacks HRW for its handling of evidence on Arab attacks on Jews, using broad and potentially biased language that could imply discrimination against Arab nations or groups. This involves making stereotypical generalizations about an entire group (Arabs) based on perceived bias towards them, which can lead to unfair treatment or discrimination. While it may not directly target Jews but instead uses such language in a broader context that could be misinterpreted as antisemitic due to HRW's known connections and focus areas during antisemitism campaigns.",No,"The tweet critiques HRW for not adequately considering evidence of Arab attacks on Jews and for using questionable sources, including those tied to pro-Iranian militias. However, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination or negative treatment based on Jewish identity. This tweet does not directly use harmful symbols, stereotypes, or language targeting Jews. It focuses on HRW's methodology and source reliability without applying any negative treatment or using antisemitic symbols. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Go on, give me an example of how Christians have encountered anything NEAR what Jews have over the past century, let alone the previous 2 millennia. Judaism is NOT ‘just personal opinion’ it’s an entire way of life &amp; culture 🤷🏼‍♀️",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). While it touches on historical perceptions of Jews, it does not express hatred towards Jews or use negative stereotypes to target them. Instead, it presents a factual comparison and argues against reducing Judaism to mere opinion, thus avoiding the dehumanizing aspects that define antisemitism.

The tweet's focus is more on correcting a misunderstanding by highlighting the long-term persecution faced by Jews rather than promoting any form of hatred or stereotyping. It does not invoke the conspiracy theory about Jews controlling society or diminish their humanity through negative character traits specific to Jewish peoplehood, which are key elements in antisemitic rhetoric.

Therefore, while the tweet may inadvertently touch on historical issues related to Jews, it does not sufficiently align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by employing the necessary dehumanizing language or stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet engages in a comparison of historical experiences between Jewish and Christian peoples. By highlighting that Jews have faced persecution over two millennia while suggesting Christians haven't, it implies a judgmental stereotype about Jews, aligning with the JDA's guidelines on essentializing and linking Jews to negative traits or actions. This makes the tweet antisemitic as it employs historical examples to stigmatize and generalize about Jewish people."

They are being herded against their will and denied God given religious rights.\n\nIt offends you?  Or does an armed citizen offend you? Nazis also disarmed the Jews prior to herding them,No,"The tweet does reference ""Jews"" in the context of historical comparisons, specifically about concentration camps and Nazi actions. However, it is more focused on critiquing non-Jewish entities (concentration camps) rather than explicitly targeting Jewish communities with antisemitic language or stereotypes. While it mentions disarming Jews, this is done as part of a broader critique without employing the specific criteria for antisemitism outlined by IHRA, such as accusatory rhetoric or denial of Holocaust truth directed at an entire group.

The tweet's primary content is a critique of concentration camps and their historical treatment, using ""Jews"" to contrast with Nazi actions. It does not employ the stereotyping, denial, or collective accusation typical of antisemitic expressions as defined by IHRA. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic under the given definition.",Yes,"The tweet references Nazi actions against Jews, which are historical examples of antisemitism as outlined in the JDA's guidelines. By mentioning that Nazis disarmed Jews prior to herding them, the speaker inadvertently supports or refers to antisemitic ideologies. This connects Jews with negative historical behaviors, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism involving harmful links or references to Jewish people based on such actions."

Exclusive for Unholy podcast \n @Freedland https://t.co/Hv4joYkbCN,No,"The tweet contains a stereotypical claim that ""most US Jews don't love Israel,"" which aligns with examples of antisemitic rhetoric such as generalizations and negative stereotypes. However, according to the IHRA definition, antisemitism requires more than just a stereotype; it involves directed hatred or perception toward Jews, often in a systemic or widespread manner. Without evidence that this tweet is part of a broader pattern of such behavior or that it directly targets Jews without prejudice, it does not fully meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not align with any category outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) as it pertains to antisemitism. The statement refers to Trump's opinion about US Jews not loving Israel, which is a personal view and does not involve discriminatory language,Essentialization, or promote any form of BDS or exclusionary policies targeting specific Jewish individuals or communities. It falls under the category of general statements without engaging in any discriminatory tactics as defined by JDA."

It makes an accusation against Jews collectively for their own oppression and uses language that could be interpreted as stereotyping or demonizing them. Additionally, it equates anti-Zionist sentiment with antisemitism, aligning with the IHRA's criteria regarding group accusations and using harmful labels to avoid direct criticism of Jewish actions or beliefs.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA. It downplays historical persecution of Jews by Israel through terms like ""antizionism,"" which frames it as an excuse or explanation for Jews' oppression, directly referencing guideline 10 that dismisses Holocaust atrocities as antisemitic.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements:** The tweet uses ""antizionism"" to label Israel's handling of Jewish persecution but argues this minimizes historical harm.
2. **Guideline 10 Application:** Denying or minimizing Holocaust atrocities is explicitly antisemitic, as the tweet does here by dismissing past persecution.
3. **Stereotyping and Labeling:** Using ""antizionism"" to associate Jews with oppression aligns with B.6, applying negative stereotypes to Israel.
4. **Contextual Criticism:** While B.12 discusses protecting speech, the tweet's broader criticism of Israel's role in historical contexts falls under this section as well.

In conclusion, the tweet employs language and associations that fit JDA criteria for antisemitism by minimizing historical harm and applying it to Israel as a group."
1442021998624792577,PamNeufeld,2021-09-26 07:03:30+00:00,0,Jews,"Appropriate, in a way. The Nazis too hated Jews. The Nazis too portrayed themselves as the victims of the Jews. The Nazis too were on the socialist Left, as their name itself conveys https://t.co/hnsbCdic1P",No,"The tweet's statement that the Nazis were victims of the Jews contributes to antisemitism by using a historical event (the Holocaust) to shift blame from the Nazis themselves onto Jews. This aligns with antisemitic practices, particularly in perpetuating negative stereotypes and denial of responsibility for past actions.",Yes,"The tweet mentions that the Nazis ""too hated Jews"" and portrayed themselves as victims of the Jews. This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jews to evil forces (the Nazis) and using them as a negative stereotype, which is defined in JDA guideline 2. Although the tweet also notes that the Nazis were on the socialist Left due to their name, this could be interpreted as indirectly associating the Nazis with anti-Semitic ideologies or victimhood, reinforcing antisemitic views about Jews.

The tweet uses language that implies Jews were responsible for the Nazis' actions through their political stance, which can be seen as equating Jews with historical antagonists. This connects the Nazis to a negative stereotype associated with Jews, thereby contributing to antisemitism under JDA guidelines.

Additionally, the use of the name ""Nazi"" conveys association with anti-Semitic ideologies, further reinforcing antisemitic narratives. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to JDA standards."

This aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes targeting specific groups for exclusion and applying harmful stereotypes. The tweet references antisemitic ideologies through the mention of Heinrich Himmler and implies connections between Jews and atrocities committed against gypsys, perpetuating outdated and harmful narratives. Therefore, it meets the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under IHRA's standards.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Heinrich Himmler ordering the extermination of gypsies in death camps alongside Jews. Under the JDA's definition, antisemitism includes discrimination and treatment against Jews as a population or institutionally linked group. This tweet directly describes an action taken against Jews by the Nazi SS, which fits the criteria for antisemitic behavior outlined in the guidelines.

The tweet does not present gypsies as a stereotype of Jews but specifically refers to a historical event targeting Jews. It mentions extermination alongside Jews, aligning with point 5 regarding direct actions against Jews.

Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition because it involves discrimination and violence against a specific group—Jews—in their population form."

Ya know kinda like you can be a proud American while still vehemently criticising it’s systemically racist institutions. Twat,Yes,"The tweet in question employs a form of antisemitism as per the IHRA definition. It suggests that supporting Israel (a Jewish state) does not necessarily imply agreement with all its policies, including those that are systematically racist. This implies a stereotype about Jews by associating them with support for Israel while rejecting certain aspects of its governance and policies. This indirect criticism aligns with antisemitic behavior as it targets Jews through their ties to Israel and critiques its actions without directly addressing Jewish people, thereby perpetuating negative stereotypes.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as it discusses respecting diverse opinions within Israel and comparing that to personal beliefs, aligning with JDA principles by avoiding discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their support for Israel."

While it mentions that 80 family members were killed by Nazis, this is presented as an unfortunate fact rather than implying a broader conspiracy or stereotype about Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which involves systematic discrimination or hatred directed at a group based on their Jewish identity.",No,"The tweet in question touches upon sensitive topics related to antisemitism but does not fully align with the JDA's definition. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Essentializing or Generalization**: The tweet refers to a tragic loss without making broad statements about Jews as a whole, thus avoiding essentialization.

2. **Lack of Conspiracy Theory Linking Jews to Evil**: While it mentions the Holocaust and victims indirectly, there is no overt connection made between Jews and the victims in a harmful way.

3. **No Coded Language or Antisemitic Symbols**: The message does not use any antisemitic symbols, coded language, or examples of violence directed at the Jewish population specifically.

4. **General Criticism Without Targeting**: The tweet's criticism is general towards those who spread hate but does not directly address or falsely accuse Jews without justification.

Given these points, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA because it does not essentialize, use stereotypical language, or make broad negative statements about the Jewish population. Instead, it reflects a personal tragedy and general criticism of those who hold harmful views."

New testament contains sayings of Jesus. But probably the Jesus character was created by Bible writers and not a real life person.,No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or express hatred towards Jews. It discusses the structure of the Bible and attributes the New Testament to Christian authors, suggesting a division between Old and New Testaments based on their intended audience rather than solely on Jewish authorship. While it could be interpreted as reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish authorship in religious texts, it does not directly perpetuate antisemitic ideologies as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly oppose Israel or promote Palestinian rights, nor does it directly address antisemitic stereotypes in a way that would categorically violate JDA guidelines. However, the mention of the Old Testament being written by ""some men"" and associating it with Jews could reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews as authors of religious texts.

This substitution aligns with antisemitic principles by employing coded language that associates a specific demographic (unvaccinated) with anti-Semitic stereotypes traditionally tied to Jews. It manipulates perceptions to fit a pre-existing narrative of persecution and hostility directed at Jewish communities.

The tweet effectively employs a coded form of antisemitism, which the JDA identifies as problematic because it substitutes a non-Jewish group into an existing anti-Semitic framework. This tactic avoids overt discrimination but still perpetuates harmful stereotypes by associating vulnerability (being unvaccinated) with targeted groups (Jews). Thus, according to the guidelines, this tweet is antisemitic."

However, it could be seen as a general criticism of laws affecting Jews' religious practices. While this might touch on anti-Semitic sentiments by implying unfair treatment towards Jews in general, the tweet lacks specific targeting, thus not fully aligning with IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to a law that inhibits Jews' ability to practice their religion and uses this as a statement directed at all Jews (Judaics). This targets an entire group by associating them with a negative outcome related to their religion, which constitutes discrimination. According to the JDA guidelines, essentializing or making generalizations about a population can be considered antisemitic if it discriminates based on ethnicity without considering individual circumstances. Thus, this tweet aligns with the definition of antisemitism as it attacks an entire group rather than addressing specific individuals."

This kind of categorization can lead to discrimination and stigmatization, aligning with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

While it raises a sensitive topic regarding Jewish heritage, it is presented neutrally without any overtly hateful language, actions, or comments targeting Jews or Jewish institutions. It merely poses a question about historical claims, which is appropriate for discussion on platforms like Twitter. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria outlined in the IHRA definition of antisemitism.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Context:** The tweet questions whether displaying modern Jews in Israel who admit to admitting the Hebrews as their ancestors constitutes ""cultural appropriation.""

2. **Applying IHRA Definition:** Antisemitism involves targeting Jews with hate, often through words or actions, using harmful stereotypes or negative character traits.

3. **Analyzing the Content:**
   - The tweet does not exhibit any overt hostility toward Jews.
   - It is a factual and neutral discussion about historical claims related to Jewish heritage.
   
4. **Evaluating against IHRA Criteria:**
   - The tweet does not use rhetoric, symbols, or double standards directed at Jews.
   - There's no mention of antisemitic ideologies, conspiracy theories, or discrimination.
   - It is a permissible conversation about a sensitive topic without crossing into antisemitism.

5. **Conclusion:** Since the tweet lacks any element that targets Jews negatively and maintains neutrality, it does not qualify as antisemitic under IHRA standards.",No,"The tweet in question poses a rhetorical inquiry regarding whether showing modern Jews from Israel who admitted ancient Hebrews were black constitutes cultural appropriation. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), cultural appropriation typically involves imposing one's culture on another without permission, often leading to negative feelings. However, this tweet is not directly engaging in any form of antisemitic behavior or promoting stereotypes that would be classified as such. It merely questions a specific historical admission regarding modern Jews and their admittance of ancient Hebrews being black, presented neutrally without any discriminatory intent or actions. Therefore, the tweet does not align with JDA guidelines for antisemitism."

Therefore, while the tweet may reflect some biases against Israel, it does not sufficiently align with antisemitic criteria as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet makes statements about respecting history and inner worlds while asserting that Jews ""aren’t going anywhere"" and rejecting a potential Palestinian state next to Israel. These comments touch on issues of coexistence without using stereotypical language but challenge the collective identity of Jews in relation to a Palestinian state, aligning with exclusionary rhetoric found in antisemitic discourse."

The sizes of the Hasidic families are tangible evidence LOL,Yes,"The tweet employs derogatory language by abbreviating ""Jewish"" as ""jews,"" which is inherently offensive. Additionally, it refers to Hasidic families in a manner that could perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jewish communities. Both elements align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, involving hateful expressions and harmful generalizations towards Jews.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet employs language that associates Hasidic Jews with wealth and control through the descriptor ""fucks,"" which may be seen as implying power or exclusive control. However, this statement lacks sufficient context to definitively classify it as antisemitic. The mention of family sizes could be interpreted in a non-judgmental manner if accompanied by context that challenges stereotypes rather than reinforcing them. Additionally, the tweet does not explicitly deny the right of Jews to exist or suggest inherent discrimination beyond vague statements about their characteristics without addressing broader implications related to their community's status and contributions. Thus, while there may be underlying suggestive language, it is not conclusively antisemitic based on the provided criteria."

However, it does not explicitly target Jewish individuals or communities with hate speech, nor does it directly accuse them of wrongdoing. Instead, it spreads a historical denial without addressing any negative actions against Jews themselves. Therefore, while potentially triggering harmful stereotypes, it doesn't meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as defined.

The tweet links to resources that deny the Holocaust and uses a comparison to antivaxxer culture, which is unrelated to Jewish persecution. The IHRA requires both perception and action directed at Jews; this tweet only provides denial without addressing their treatment or well-being. Thus, it doesn't constitute antisemitism under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration. It provides information about historical resources without any discriminatory intent or manipulation. While the suggestion to link COVID-19 precautions to the Holocaust could be misleading, it is important that such a connection would require context to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Without evidence of intent to manipulate perceptions through irrelevant parallels, the tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior based on JDA guidelines."

While it makes a general statement comparing Jews and Catholics, this does not inherently involve hatred, discrimination, or any form of expression directed toward Jewish people or their property. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition. The tweet is neutral in its content regarding Jews and focuses on a general statement without specific prejudice.",No,"The tweet does not present as antisemitic content based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It merely invites someone to share her thoughts on Jews and Catholics without targeting Jews specifically or engaging in any manner that would fit within JDA's guidelines for antisemitism. There is no indication of discrimination, prejudice, or hostile references towards Jews; instead, it appears as a neutral statement regarding an intersectional topic."
