It mentions an anti-Jewish riot as a historical event but then celebrates progress by highlighting Israel's current positive status and celebrating Shabbat. There are no overtly negative or stereotypical portrayals of Jews, nor does it use harmful stereotypes about their community or state.",No,"The tweet does mention an anti-Semitic event (an anti-Semitic riot) from 100 years ago but does so neutrally within a positive context of celebrating progress in a Jewish state. It avoids essentializing Jews or using any coded language that could imply antisemitism. The reference to the riot is part of historical context without reinforcing stereotypes, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It uses racial slurs directed at Native Americans and Blacks, which can be interpreted as a broader attack on Jews due to the perceived connection between their race and these groups. Additionally, the dehumanizing language (""IDIOTS"") and context about discussions involving ""bullshit"" can imply judgment towards Jews by associating them with such harmful actions. The inflammatory tone and use of slurs contribute to spreading negative stereotypes against Jews, even indirectly, making it antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA. It employs offensive language like ""IDIOTS"" and ""ATROCity"", which are personal slurs. Under section A.1, essentializing or generalizing about a population is problematic. Section B.7 accuses Jews of collective responsibility for state actions without context, reinforcing antisemitism. The aggressive tone towards other groups violates guidelines 12-14 by not tempering speech and respecting their protected status. Thus, the tweet's use of slurs and dismissive remarks targets multiple protected groups, qualifying it as antisemitic."

This could be seen as employing a stereotype or generalization about Jews, which fits within the IHRA definition of antisemitism that involves using negative stereotypes or perceptions directed at Jewish individuals or groups. Therefore, it qualifies as antisemitic according to the provided definition.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses language that essentializes Jews by associating them with advice on beating a wife and punitive measures against them. This aligns with guideline 1, which prohibits essentializing or making sweeping generalizations about a population. Additionally, it reflects a stereotype where Jews are stigmatized based on their identity, touching upon the theme of treating Jews as responsible for personal actions not entirely under their control. Thus, it meets criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

While it references historical atrocities, it doesn't meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism because it isn't directed at Jews specifically but through a broader analogy. Antisemitism typically involves direct targeting, prejudice, or discrimination against Jews, which this tweet does not do.

---

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It draws a historical analogy between violent targeting of Muslims and the Holocaust committed against Jews. However, this comparison does not essentialize Jews into being inherently evil or tied to a shared inherent evil beyond their actions. Antisemitism often involves equating Jews with something negative, but simply drawing a parallel without implying an inherent evil specific to Jewish people does not meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism. The tweet avoids labeling Jews as inherently evil and instead focuses on historical actions, thus it is not considered antisemitic under the given guidelines."

It does not exhibit any form of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA, which involves targeted hatred towards Jews or their communities. Instead, it reflects a shared human experience among diaspora and Israeli Jewish communities, focusing on remembrance without targeting or stereotyping Jews themselves.",No,"The tweet promotes a commemorative event for Jewish communities dispersed in Arab countries, focusing on shared traditions and collective remembrance. It does not engage in any form of discrimination, prejudice, or harmful stereotypes about Jews. Instead, it supports the survival and memory of these communities without promoting any antisemitic narratives or actions.

The tweet complies with JDA guidelines by avoiding any references to Jewish evil associations or harmful generalizations. It is a peaceful, inclusive initiative that respects the dignity and continuity of Jewish identities across cultures."

It frames blaming them for a disease outbreak without evidence and suggests a discrimination against Jewish communities through language and actions aimed at supporting them, thus fitting the criteria of targeting specific groups with negative stereotypes and discrimination.

The tweet's approach uses stigmatization of Orthodox Jews, aligning with antisemitic practices that involve targeting specific communities based on stereotypes or prejudice. By implying that supporting Jewish communities is harder than necessary, it discriminates against them without providing evidence, reinforcing a hostile perception towards Jewish people.",No,"The tweet does not directly engage with the concept of antisemitism by essentializing or generalizing about Orthodox Jews. It suggests that community involvement through translation and education would be more effective than blaming a specific Jewish group, which is a neutral approach to addressing public health issues. Therefore, it does not align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as it does not involve discrimination or stereotype-making against a population.

The tweet is making a general statement about community efforts rather than targeting Orthodox Jews specifically beyond their mention in the context of disease prevention. It avoids the broader implications that would make it antisemitic, such as associating the group with negative traits without specific context or intent to generalize."

This aligns with antisemitic behavior as it involves perpetuating harmful stereotypes and potentially contributing to hatred or discrimination against Jews, even if not directly targeting them.

The reasoning is that the tweet uses generalizations that could incite hatred by associating negative comments about one group (blacks) with consequences that might affect another (Jews), thereby reflecting antisemitic tactics such as stereotyping. This makes it a form of antisemitism according to IHRA's definition, as it employs negative character traits and harmful generalizations.",No,"The tweet humorously compares the image of Kanye West and Nick Cannon with a stereotypical depiction of Jews, suggesting that such negative remarks would lead to professional consequences. While it touches on themes of stereotyping and generalization about Jews, it does so in a light-hearted manner without explicitly endorsing antisemitic views. The humorous stretch might downplay the harmfulness of such stereotypes, potentially avoiding overt antisemitism despite its underlying intent.

The tweet is not overtly antisemitic as it does not explicitly endorse or promote harmful stereotypes but rather uses humor to critique potential negative portrayals. However, the suggestion that such comments would lead to professional disqualification could be seen as stretching the definition of stereotyping without context, thus touching on the problematic aspects defined by JDA."

However, it does not explicitly target Jews or use language that directly aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which requires specific forms of discrimination or hatred towards Jews based on their identity. The tweet's focus is more on broader societal issues rather than antisemitic acts or perceptions.

The tweet's content does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA because it does not involve direct harm, physical manifestation, or stereotyping directed specifically at Jewish individuals as per the definition provided. Instead, it raises a general concern about attention given to certain groups without explicitly targeting Jews in a way that fits the IHRA's framework.",Yes,"The tweet employs stereotyping by suggesting that issues related to ""Jews"" are not taken seriously unless framed in a context reminiscent of religious groups like church or mosque. This aligns with the Jerusalem Declaration's guidelines, particularly its emphasis on applying negative stereotypes and essentializing groups as a form of antisemitism. By implying that Jewish concerns are dismissed without addressing them directly, the tweet targets the group collectively, thereby contributing to antisemitic sentiments."

While it conveys a negative sentiment towards Jews, it does not directly manifest antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which requires overt acts or expressions against Jews, not just emotional reactions related to societal issues.",No,"The tweet ""I had to leave Austria due to the persecution of Jews. #disgusting"" does not qualify as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet is a personal statement about an individual's experience leaving Austria due to what they perceive as Jewish persecution. It uses the term ""persecution"" in a general sense, referencing historical events without making specific stereotypical associations or denying Jewish people their rights. The use of a hashtag for emphasis does not inherently target Jews but expresses a reaction to a personal experience rather than systemic discrimination. Therefore, it falls outside the guidelines that define antisemitism as discriminatory acts against specific populations based on their Jewishness."

It is wrong, it is dangerous, and it is harmful af. \n\n1/x thread",Yes,"The tweet expresses strong anger at a historical narrative that suggests Jews were passive during the Holocaust. This aligns with antisemitic ideas where Jews are collectively blamed for not protesting, contributing to harmful stereotypes about their behavior and character. The use of negative language and potential justification for such narratives in public discourse fits within IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it perpetuates stereotypes and uses such content to incite negative emotions towards Jews.",No,"The tweet expresses anger at a historical narrative about Jews being passive during the Holocaust, but it doesn't specifically target or generalize negatively towards Jews based on their ethnicity according to JDA guidelines. Antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as a group, not just critical remarks about historical events without such targeting.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism**: Antisemitism per JDA is about treating Jews as a group negatively due to their ethnicity, not general criticisms of a historical event like the Holocaust.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet**: The tweet attacks a negative stereotype without directly addressing or criticizing Jewish people specifically.

3. **Applying Guidelines**: Since there's no mention of Israel/Palestine or specific antisemitic ideologies (like conspiracy theories), it doesn't meet JDA criteria for antisemitism directed at Jews as a group.

4. **Conclusion**: The tweet is harmful but not antisemitic because it doesn't fit the definition targeting Jewish people specifically based on ethnicity."

While it could be part of a broader context where antisemitic narratives are discussed, as a standalone statement, it lacks direct antisemitic content. Therefore, according to the IHRA's criteria, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet ""Jews Top Target of Hate Crimes in 2019"" does not fully align with the antisemitic definition as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Guideline 3**: The tweet refers to Jews as a target, which could be seen as stigmatizing them without providing evidence or context about how this affects individual Jewish people or their rights.

2. **Lack of Denial of Rights**: While the tweet states that Jews are targeted, it does not explicitly deny the right of Jews to exist and flourish in Israel. This is crucial because guideline 10 emphasizes denial as a form of antisemitism.

3. **Guideline 6-8**: The tweet doesn't apply broader antisemitic stereotypes to specific Jewish communities or individuals, nor does it suggest hostility directed at particular Jewish people.

4. **Contextual Interpretation**: Without context about the impact on individual Jewish lives or denial of their rights, the tweet's reference to hate crimes against Jews as a group may not meet all criteria for being considered antisemitic under the JDA.

Thus, while the tweet targets Jews broadly, it lacks the specific elements that would classify it as antisemitic according to the given guidelines."

This aligns with the IHRA's definition as it involves a dehumanizing stereotype that could be used to support claims of systemic oppression against Jews, thereby perpetuating antisemitism.

The tweet is problematic because it generalizes about Jewish identity in a way that reduces them to a racial category, which can lead to discrimination and reinforce negative stereotypes. This stereotyping, combined with the suggestion that such an approach could affect statistics on systemic oppression, touches on key aspects of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet makes a problematic stereotype by categorizing Jews as ""brown people,"" which is an essentialization based on a trait that can perpetuate systemic biases and racism. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines regarding essentializing populations, leading to biased generalizations and contributing to antisemitism."

Christians enslaved you but Jews are the world’s evil... lmao,Yes,"The tweet employs several elements of antisemitism as per the IHRA definition. It uses stereotypes to dismiss the contributions of non-Jewish groups by implying that laws and society have been shaped by European Christianity, thereby marginalizing other cultures, including Jewish ones. It also associates Jews with oppression (as in ""Christians enslaved you"") and dehumanizes them as the world's ""evil,"" which are harmful generalizations. These actions align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, such as using stereotypes to target Jews negatively.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs several criteria outlined in the JDA to propagate antisemitic ideologies. 

1. **Application of Negative Stereotypes**: The tweet uses the label ""Jews"" to associate them with negative traits, such as being evil and controlling global affairs, which falls under guideline 6.

2. **Denying Rights Based on Identity**: By suggesting that Jews are inherently evil, the tweet undermines their legitimate rights in Israel, aligning with guideline 10.

3. **Pejorative Language**: The use of terms like ""enslaved"" to describe Christians introduces a harmful stereotype about an entire group (Jews), which is a form of antisemitism as per guideline 7 and 8.

4. **Coded Language**: The implication that Jews control key institutions, akin to the classic antisemitic notion that Jews are antagonistic forces, supports guidelines 3 and 10.

In conclusion, the tweet manipulates stereotypes and denies legitimate rights based on Jewish identity, thereby fitting the definition of antisemitism as per the JDA."

They don’t like Jews."" is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. This determination is based on the following reasoning:

1. **Targeting a Jewish Individual**: The tweet suggests that K. Thomas, who is being criticized about Biden's statements, may have a negative view toward Jews. If K. Thomas has a Jewish background or identity (not explicitly clear from the context), this tweet directly targets an individual of Jewish descent.

2. **Expression of Hatred and Stereotypes**: The statement implies surprise at Biden's criticism without addressing whether the critic is Jewish, potentially leading to stereotyping about Jews in general. This aligns with the IHRA definition where hatred toward specific individuals or groups can be antisemitic if directed against a perceived stereotype.

3. **Contextual Implication**: While the tweet does not explicitly label K. Thomas as Jewish, it carries an undertone that could be interpreted as implying a negative stereotype about Jews. The context of targeting an individual whose identity may be associated with Jewish heritage without explicit denial or affirmation makes this tweet significant in terms of antisemitism.

In conclusion, given the potential stereotyping and specificity toward a perceived Jewish individual, the tweet is classified as antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.",Yes,"The tweet uses a statement that associates Jews with negativity (""they don’t like Jews"") in response to another tweet without providing specific context or justification.

I pray Nigeria is not my country, &amp; I can't uphold her honor &amp; glory or be faithful &amp; honest, so break it God Ise #TwoNigeriaS @POTUS @10DowningStreet @UN @MaziNnamdiKanu",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the tweet provided is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the tweet again:
""Asking a Biafran to pray for Unity of zoo Nigeria, is like asking Jews to pray for Adolf Hitler's long life. I pray Nigeria is not my country, &amp; I can't uphold her honor &amp; glory or be faithful &amp; honest, so break it God Ise #TwoNigeriaS @POTUS @10DowningStreet @UN @MaziNnamdiKanu""

The tweet seems to make a comparison between Biafrans asking for prayer related to Nigeria and Jews being asked about Hitler's life. The user then expresses regret over praying for Nigeria as their country, implying it shouldn't be his.

Looking at the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes targeting Jews or non-Jews, using speech, writing, etc., with negative stereotypes or blame. The tweet uses a stereotype by comparing Jews to Hitler, a Nazi figure, and suggests that Nigeria's prayer request is irrelevant, which could imply Jews are problematic.

However, the tweet also mentions praying for a person who is a Biafran leader, not necessarily targeting Jews specifically but using a stereotype about Jews associating with Hitler. The user's language is strong and critical towards Jews without directly attacking them, implying a broader judgment against their community based on the comparison to Hitler.

I need to check if this falls under any of IHRA's categories: it's using a negative stereotype (Jews = Hitler), making dehumanizing allegations, and targeting a group (Jews) by implication. It's also using a public figure (Hitler) as a representative of Jews, which is problematic.

So yes, the tweet exhibits antisemitic behavior as per IHRA because it uses a harmful stereotype and implies that Jews are equivalent to Hitler through a Biafran leader analogy.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet exhibits antisemitic behavior according to the IHRA definition. It employs a harmful stereotype by equating Jews with Adolf Hitler, using a comparison that distorts their image. Additionally, it makes dehumanizing allegations against Jews, which falls under the category of using sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. The tweet's language perpetuates prejudice and undermines the legitimate identities of Jews, thereby qualifying as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet uses a harmful stereotype by equating Jews with Adolf Hitler's legacy, which aligns with JDA guidelines on antisemitism. This comparison normalizes a negative stereotype and manipulates political figures in Nigeria, fitting the definition of antisemitic behavior as it essentializes Jews and leverages their perceived evil nature to influence others."

However, without explicit context or references that directly associate the tweet with any form of antisemitism against Jews, it is not clear-cut. The IHRA definition emphasizes specific manifestation towards Jews, and while the tweet's mention of Black people could be part of broader narratives, it does not explicitly target Jews in a way that aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.

Without explicit context or references to Jews being targeted or attacked, the tweet is unlikely to fall under the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet utilizes a stereotypical accusation that associates Black people with the act of attacking Jews. This falls under point 3 of the JDA guidelines, where antisemitic speech can manifest in negative stereotypes or generalizations about a group based on their identity rather than individual attributes.

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** Antisemitism is defined by IHRA as hatred or negative perceptions directed specifically at Jews, often through speech, actions, or symbols.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet Content:**
   - The tweet mentions Cleopatra's Greek heritage but then shifts to argue that Israelis are natives due to their history in the region.
   - It supports Israel's claim of a native presence without explicitly targeting or attacking Jews.

3. **Evaluating for Hatred or Stereotypes:**
   - No overt hatred toward Jews is evident; instead, it implicitly supports a positive narrative about Israelis' heritage.
   - There’s no use of negative stereotypes typical in antisemitism.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The tweet doesn't meet IHRA's criteria because it lacks directed negativity or stereotyping towards the Jewish community.
   - It may inadvertently support a positive image, which isn’t inherently antisemitic without targeting specific Jews.

Thus, the tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet addresses the accusation of promoting ""color blind casting,"" which implies a lack of distinction based on race without justification. By suggesting that Jews are not natives but immigrants, the speaker may be essentializing their group, aligning with the JDA's definition and guidelines, particularly those regarding racial stereotypes and essentialization (Point 2). Additionally, by framing an argument against colorblindness while using terms that could imply a stereotype about Jews' presence in the region, it contributes to antisemitic content."

The mention of ""Nabuid_Hild"" is ambiguous and the tweet does not clearly link it to harmful stereotypes. While the reference to Jews could be problematic in a broader context, here it seems more like cultural attribution rather than direct antisemitic content.

However, if ""Nabuid_Hild"" is indeed an anti-Semitic text associating him with evil, then this tweet would violate JDA guidelines by promoting negative stereotypes about Jews. But without knowing the nature of ""Nabuid_Hild,"" it's uncertain. The positive mention in the Bible and cultural context mitigate the antisemitic risk.

Jesus blessed her faith. https://t.co/ObDe14EGZC",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or make negative stereotypes about Jews. It presents a narrative comparing religious practices of Gentiles and others without directly addressing Jews. However, if the comparison is interpreted as implying that Jews are conformist or less faithful, it could be seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes indirectly. Since the IHRA definition emphasizes negative portrayal of Jews, even an indirect implication could raise concerns, but in this case, there's no explicit reference to Israel or Jews being targeted negatively. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not engage with or apply stereotypical language against Jews in a discriminatory manner. It presents a contrast between Gentile spiritual practices and Jewish teachings, which can be interpreted within a neutral religious context rather than targeting Jews as a group. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA)."

It does not mention Jews or express hatred toward them. Instead, it discusses a debate involving Muslims in general and references a religious site shared by both Muslims and Jews. There is no indication of stereotyping, discrimination, or any form of prejudice against Jews. The tweet appears to be neutral regarding religion and identity, focusing instead on broader topics such as interfaith dialogue.",No,"The tweet in question does not demonstrate a clear application of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The user expresses disagreement with someone named Jinnah about whether they were correct, mentioning Al-Aqsa Mosque as part of their reasoning. While the mention of Al-Aqsa Mosque is significant in Islamic contexts and could imply connections to Muslim or Jewish identities, the tweet does not explicitly use language that discriminates against Jews, essentializes them, or employs harmful stereotypes. The content appears to stem from a personal disagreement rather than engaging in systematic discrimination or reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish people. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Like the Ethiopian Jews in Israel being sterilized without consent, being discriminated against.   Because it goes hand in hand.",No,"The tweet does not directly address antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It mentions discrimination against Ethiopian Jews and ties it to racism but does not explicitly label this behavior as antisemitic. Antisemitism, according to the IHRA, involves specific acts or expressions directed toward Jewish individuals or groups. While the tweet highlights a real issue, it falls short of meeting the criteria for antisemitism by lacking explicit targeting or labeling of Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet references specific instances of discrimination against Ethiopian Jews in Israel, which constitutes antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It directly addresses a form of discrimination against a specific Jewish subgroup, aligning with guidelines that prohibit treating particular groups based on their ethnicity or religion."

This incitement of hatred towards a specific group (Jews) due to their religious identity aligns with the IHRA's definition, which includes promoting or inciting hatred toward Jews. While it doesn't directly target individuals, its intent to provoke anti-Semitic sentiment fits within the broader category of antisemitism defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA because it discriminates against Jews by targeting them based on their religious definitions. It uses religious identifiers as a basis for harassment, aligning with B.7 which criticizes treating Jews as agents of a country. Additionally, spreading misinformation specifically towards Jewish groups without justification also reflects harmful tactics typical of antisemitism."

It positions Korea as more hated than Jews without specific antisemitic context, focusing instead on broader hatred towards non-Jews. Therefore, it doesn't meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving Jews specifically.",No,"The tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses negative stereotypes about Jews being involved in the slave trade and being disliked by others, associating them with William Leeve without justification. However, these associations do not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined because they lack evidence of systematic discrimination or generalization against the Jewish population. The tweet does not explicitly promote or uphold harmful stereotypes that would be classified under JDA's guidelines for antisemitism.

This analysis follows JDA's definitions and guidelines by recognizing that while the tweet may contain stereotypical remarks about Jews, it does not meet the specific criteria outlined in the Declaration for what constitutes antisemitism."
