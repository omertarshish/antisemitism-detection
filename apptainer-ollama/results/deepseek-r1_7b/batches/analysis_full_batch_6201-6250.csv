The tweet is antisemitic because it uses stereotyping (implying Jews engage in harmful activities) and accusatory language targeting a community, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet contains broad, general statements about Al Sharpton and Bill de Blasio without specific evidence.

This aligns with JDA's guidelines, particularly A.1 regarding essentializing populations based on inherent traits tied to Jewish identity. Additionally, it mirrors the harmful stereotype without providing factual basis or justification, reinforcing antisemitic ideology by projecting negative stereotypes about an entire group.

Additionally, the use of derogatory language without context that could be interpreted as a stereotype rather than a generalization about Jews makes it less likely to fall under antisemitism.

The tweet uses ""Jews"" as a group label, but without any specific or clear evidence of antisemitic intent in its content beyond potentially offensive language. The statement does not explicitly deny or minimize the Holocaust or use any of the examples provided in section A.5 through 8 that would classify it as antisemitic.

Instead, it refers to the killings of Jews alongside Christians and mentions Biafran land without a clear connection to Jews. Since there is no indication that the tweet discriminates against Jews based on their identity, it does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as a perception directed towards Jewish individuals or communities, often involving negative stereotypes or blame. In this case, while the tweet mentions ""Jews,"" it also refers to Biafran land without associating it with Jews, which is conflated with the Indigenous People's Liberation Army (IPLA). The mention of Christians alongside Jews suggests a broader issue and does not specifically target Jews as a group based on their identity. Therefore, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA's criteria.

In conclusion, while the tweet raises concerns about violence against Jews, it is not categorized as antisemitic because it does not explicitly or overtly target Jews as a specific group with negative stereotypes or discrimination based on their Jewish identity.",No,"The tweet addresses the issue of killings involving both Jews and Christians in specific regions. While it uses hashtags to emphasize the problem, it does not explicitly target Jews but mentions them alongside Christians without distinguishing their treatment beyond the act of killing. Under the JDA guidelines, particularly point 2, which warns against stereotyping Jews as linked to evil, this tweet could be interpreted as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews if taken out of context or used to justify antisemitic behavior elsewhere. However, since it does not explicitly target Jews and instead refers to a broader issue without specific stereotyping, it may not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic under the JDA definition."

1268969451950571522,NeutralJing,2020-06-05 18:14:28+00:00,0,Jews,"They didn�t just blame the virus on another country, they blamed EVERYTHING on EVERYONE else: Blacks, Muslims, Jews, LGBTQ+, etc. They even blamed people with underlying health conditions, because why not??   Any individual and group living on the fringe of society was marked.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the tweet provided is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll recall the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. It involves a perception or expression of hatred toward Jews, either directly or indirectly, through words, actions, or symbols. The examples given include various forms like speech, writing, visual acts, etc., and often involve negative stereotypes or blame towards Jewish people.

Now, looking at the tweet: ""They didn't just blame the virus on another country, they blamed EVERYTHING on EVERYONE else: Blacks, Muslims, Jews, LGBTQ+, etc. They even blamed people with underlying health conditions, because why not?? Any individual and group living on the fringe of society was marked.""

The key points here are that the tweet is accusing a broad range of groups of being responsible for viruses, discrimination against minorities like Blacks, Muslims, and LGBTQ+ individuals, as well as those with health conditions. It's making a generalization by blaming an entire category (everyone else) for various issues.

According to the IHRA definition, this could be seen as antisemitic if it involves negative stereotypes or blame directed specifically at Jewish people or groups related to them, like Israel. The tweet does mention ""Jews"" explicitly and includes other stereotypical groups, which might fit under the category of antisemitic rhetoric.

Moreover, the tweet uses a broad brushstrokes approach, associating all these groups with issues without specific evidence, which is similar to the kind of generalizations that can be part of antisemitism. It's also making broad claims about responsibility and discrimination without targeting any specific individual or group beyond the stereotypical categories mentioned.

So, considering that the tweet explicitly includes a mention of Jews (as ""Jews"" in the list) and uses broad accusations against Jewish people by name, it seems to fit within the IHRA's definition. The use of negative stereotypes about Jews as part of a broader critique of society could be considered antisemitic.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it includes a direct accusation against Jews (""Jews"" in the list) and employs broad, stereotypical language that associates Jewish people with various negative traits or issues. This fits within the category of antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which involves expressions of hatred toward Jews through words, actions, or stereotypes.

The tweet's explicit mention of ""Jews"" alongside other stereotypical groups like Blacks and Muslims, along with its general accusations without targeting specific individuals beyond these categories, aligns with the definition provided. This form of broad categorization and generalization can be seen as part of antisemitic rhetoric, as it involves negative perceptions and stereotypes directed at Jewish people or their community.

Additionally, the tweet's approach mirrors historical instances where antisemitism has been used to blamed groups for societal issues without specific evidence, reinforcing a broader pattern of discrimination. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria set forth by IHRA for antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While the tweet includes a mention of Jews among its broad accusations against various groups, it does not essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews beyond their inclusion. The tweet's focus is on blaming multiple groups, including those with health conditions and other demographic categories, without specifically targeting Jews as a distinct group with inherent negative qualities. Therefore, the inclusion of Jews in this context does not meet the specific criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA guidelines."

Thanks but no thanks!,Yes,"The tweet from @BlakeFlayton expresses a sentiment of deep-seated hatred towards Jews and suggests moving everyone to Israel for the opportunity to convert or die. While this does not directly match one of the IHRA's specific examples, such as accusing Jews of conspiring or promoting antisemitic ideologies through harmful statements about conversion, it can be interpreted as stereotyping and marginalizing Jewish communities by encouraging suicide and suggesting a form of assimilation that could contribute to antisemitism.",No,"Blake Flayton's tweet suggests a negative perception of Jews and proposes ideas about conversion or death as part of a conspiracy theory. However, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves specific prohibited practices such as essentializing or using symbols tied to evil. While the tweet conveys harmful sentiments towards Jews, it does not explicitly use the JDA's definitions of antisemitism, such as hidden references to evil or discriminative language. Therefore, while the message is harmful, it doesn't meet the criteria outlined in the JDA guidelines for antisemitism.

It employs a harmful stereotype by labeling individuals who mock Jews as ""rad,"" which involves negative and pejorative language directed at Jewish people. This use of a negative trait to criticize others' actions toward Jews aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes the use of harmful stereotypes and discrimination against Jewish individuals or groups.

The tweet's content reflects a form of antisemitism by perpetuating a stereotype that associates mockery of Jews with positive qualities (""rad""), thereby contributing to a negative perception of Jewish people. This aligns with the IHRA's definition as it involves expressing hatred toward Jews through speech, specifically targeting their behavior in a dehumanizing way.

While the tweet does not directly attack the state of Israel or historical events like the Holocaust, its harmful wording towards individuals who mock Jews still qualifies under the broader umbrella of antisemitism. The use of such language to dismiss or stereotype others' actions toward Jews fits within the IHRA's framework for identifying antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit any form of antisemitism as per the JDA.

While the tweet could be interpreted as targeting Jewish communities by name, without explicit hatred or discrimination, it's more of an accusation rather than direct antisemitism.

The tweet is considered neutral in its accusations and does not explicitly target Jews with any form of hatred or discrimination beyond naming them as a group facing attacks. Thus, it isn't classified as antisemitic under the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly claim that Jews were being attacked by the NYPD.

**Final Answer:**
DECISION: No",Yes,"The tweet ""Rabbi Bertram Korn Speaks: Jews in the Slave Trade"" is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). This determination is based on the fact that the statement associates Jews with the slave trade, which could lead to stereotyping.

The JDA considers any form of discrimination or generalization about race, religion, or ethnicity as antisemitic if it leads to stereotyping or bias."

However, upon closer examination, the tweet's statement is factually incorrect because slave ships were owned by private individuals or corporations long before the Holocaust. The association of Jews with the ownership of these ships could be seen as perpetuating stereotypes that oversimplify historical contexts and aligns with antisemitic narratives.

While it doesn't directly address Jews, the use of negative language and denial of positive identities could be seen as perpetuating a form of racial优越性, which aligns with aspects of antisemitism by essentializing a group's identity through negative stereotypes or conspiracies.

However, upon further reflection, considering that the tweet is general in nature and does not specifically address Jews but applies negative language to Whites, it might not directly fall under JDA's definition. The guidelines emphasize targeting Jews specifically, so this tweet may not strictly adhere to antisemitism as defined by JDA because it doesn't focus on Jews or their collective identity but instead critiques a broader societal construct of positive identity.

But the reasoning is somewhat complicated because the tweet does use the same flawed logic (denying others' right to positive identity) which can be seen as promoting negative stereotypes, albeit against Whites. Therefore, while it's not explicitly targeting Jews, the structure leans towards antisemitism by applying negative reasoning. However, since JDA focuses on Jews specifically, and this tweet doesn't directly reference them, perhaps the answer is No.

But considering that the tweet uses the same flawed logic asJudaism promotes for Jews, which could be seen as a general form of antisemitism applicable to any group, including Whites. Therefore, it's a complex call, but since JDA specifically targets Jews, and this tweet doesn't reference them directly, perhaps the answer is No.

Wait, the JDA defines antisemitism as directed against Jews because they are Jews. The tweet does not target Jews but uses similar reasoning to deny others' positive identities, which could be seen as promoting a form of exclusionary identity that's applicable across different groups, including Jews. However, since the tweet doesn't specifically address Jews or their collective rights, it might not fall under JDA's definition.

One of them was a 12-year old boy Szymek Zelmanowicz who was murdered in a gas chamber. https://t.co/X2nfeRsdfw,No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism as per the IHRA definition. It refers to the displacement and persecution of Polish Jews, a specific subgroup within Judaism. Antisemitism under IHRA involves targeting all Jews broadly or using expressions like conspiracy theories against Jewish people globally. This tweet lacks such elements; it focuses on a particular ethnic group (Polish Jews) without generalizing to all Jews.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition of Antisemitism:** Antisemitism under IHRA involves hatred toward Jews, expressed in various forms, targeting individuals, communities, or institutions.
2. **Analysis of the Tweet:** The tweet describes events involving Polish Jews being displaced by Germans and later deported to Auschwitz. It mentions a victim identified as a 12-year-old Polish Jew.
3. **Comparison with IHRA Criteria:**
   - Targets a specific subgroup (Polish Jews) rather than all Jews or the broader Jewish community.
   - Does not use stereotyping, conspiracy theories about a ""Jewish conspiracy,"" or references to Israel in an antisemitic context.
4. **Conclusion:** The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as it focuses on a specific ethnic group without broadly targeting Jews or employing the specified forms of hatred.

Thus, the tweet is not considered antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet discusses the persecution of Polish Jews during World War II, specifically mentioning their displacement and deportation to Auschwitz. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group. However, this tweet does not target or stereotype Jews in a way that would be considered antisemitic. It focuses on the actions of the Nazis against Polish Jews, which is unrelated to antisemitism targeting Jews themselves. The JDA defines antisemitism when it comes to discrimination or negative portrayal directed specifically at Jews as a group, but this tweet does not do so; it pertains to another Jewish community. Therefore, the tweet is not antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines."

It references exterminating Jews, which targets their right of existence (guideline 10).

This interpretation hinges on potential perceptions that attribute negative character traits or stigmatization to Jews through critical remarks about reductionism.

The tweet may be seen as indirectly targeting Jewish people by associating them with a method of analysis (reductionism) that is deemed flawed, which aligns with antisemitic tropes by singling out Jews for such critique. Therefore, based on the IHRA's broad definition encompassing any form of hatred or negative characterization toward Jews, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic.

The tweet's focus is on opposing violence against an ethnic group without conflating it with Jews beyond a neutral reference to their identity.

---

The tweet in question uses the hashtag #IStandWithIPOB and states: ""The Nigerian government must stop killing Biafrans because they are Jews and Christians."" It is tagged with several prominent U.S. and African political figures, suggesting a call for solidarity against the violence directed at Biafrans.

Given IHRA's definition of antisemitism as targeting Jews specifically or using negative stereotypes about them, this tweet does not engage in antisemitic behavior because it refers to Biafrans—a distinct ethnic group—as both Jewish and Christian. There is no specific targeting of Jews themselves; instead, the tweet addresses a separate identity category. Therefore, under IHRA's standards, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.

The tweet could be seen as conflating two groups—an ethnic reference (Biafrans) with the Jewish people—but without explicitly targeting or stereotyping Jews beyond their context within the narrative of Biafra opposition. Since it does not directly address Jews or use negative connotations about them, it avoids the antisemitic categorization outlined by IHRA.

Instead, it accuses a campaign of being funded by ""them,"" referring to what is perceived as a Jewish group. This could imply that because the funder is seen as Jewish, the campaign's actions are being blamed on Jews. However, without explicit references to Jewish people or groups and given the neutral context provided, this tweet does not clearly align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It might be interpreted in a pejorative way if the audience perceives the funders as Jewish, but it is not inherently an act of antisemitism unless there's a known bias toward Jews in those funder groups.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly state or imply direct antisemitic content. It simply accuses a Make It Right campaign of targeting Jewish people based on their association with the campaign, but it does not explicitly label the campaign or its supporters as antisemitic. While there are elements that could be interpreted as stereotyping or reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews (linked to the campaign), without explicit denigration or discriminatory language towards Jews themselves, it doesn't meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism. The tweet is more about the campaign's funding rather than targeting Jews directly."

This could be interpreted as stereotyping or generalizing about Jewish people, potentially leading to perceptions of hatred or discrimination against them. While it doesn't explicitly target Jewish individuals, the nature of the comment could be seen as antisemitic by implying negative traits associated with Jewishness, fitting within the IHRA's definition that involves directed expressions of hatred toward Jews in various forms.",No,"The tweet uses ""jews"" in a slang context, which may carry some negative connotation but does not involve systematic antisemitic elements such as coded language, conspiracy theories, or references to harmful stereotypes linking Jews with evil. It appears as a joke without targeting any specific group beyond their name, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA guidelines."

""",No,"The tweet does not exhibit behaviors consistent with antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It is a declarative statement expressing an opinion about the need for safety measures for Jews in Israel, rather than targeting individuals, groups, properties, institutions, or spreading hate expressions towards Jews. The IHRA focuses on acts of hatred and discrimination, which this tweet does not demonstrate.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet expresses concern about safety within Israel regarding Jews, which is a valid critique of state policies. It does not employ any of the JDA's guidelines that involve discrimination, prejudice, or negative stereotypes directed at Jews specifically because they are Jewish. The criticism is directed at the government's actions rather than individual Jews or use of symbols. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic."

While it implies dislike towards Jews, this is presented in a personal and non-systematic manner, focusing on the individuals mentioned rather than broader Jewish communities.",No,"The tweet in question uses words to express a negative sentiment towards Jews in general. However, it targets specific individuals tagged (such as @chaposarechumps) rather than making broad generalizations about all Jews or employing harmful stereotypes. Since it doesn't meet any of the JDA's guidelines for antisemitism—such as essentializing, using coded language, or targeting a group beyond individual cases—it is not considered antisemitic under the given definition."

Arabs never wanted to live in peace with the Jews and that brought on them all their suffering. Never agreed to pragmatic resolution like the Jews did. Blame Ur leadership,No,"The tweet suggests that Jewish presence in Israel has led to Palestinian suffering through inaction (not agreeing to pragmatic solutions) and implies a problematic presence without providing concrete evidence or supporting antisemitism. While it may touch on stereotypes, it doesn't explicitly use the IHRA's definition of hatred or language targeting Jews specifically beyond general criticism, which isn't sufficient for classification under IHRA's standards.",No,"The tweet contains elements that may contribute to antisemitism by using stereotypes and generalizations about Jews and Arabs. While it doesn't explicitly label Israel as evil or perpetuate direct antisemitic stereotypes, the statements imply oversimplifications and can be seen as contributing to harmful narratives that ignore historical context and complexities of interfaith relations. However, without explicit discrimination against individual groups, it's not definitively antisemitic but leans towards the spectrum based on its content."

I think They Are realizing that Democrats like Deblasio are Incompetent ignorant Fools !   Democrats Are a Cancer To American ????Society ! https://t.co/TFS840vQG0,No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or discriminate against Jews as a protected group. It uses negative language about Democrats in general, which could be interpreted as a stereotype or generalization. However, according to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves directed hatred toward Jews, either directly or through stereotyping their people. Since this tweet does not specifically address Jews but rather makes broad statements about Democrats and societal impact, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA's working definition.

The tweet uses language that could be seen as a stereotype targeting Democrats (a political group) in general, which indirectly associates them with negative traits. However, this does not specifically target Jews but rather makes a broader critique of a political party and its members. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of being antisemitic under IHRA's definition.

In summary, while the tweet may carry connotations of anti-Semitism by associating Democrats with negative stereotypes, it does not directly or specifically target or discriminate against Jews as a group based on their identity.",Yes,"The tweet contains elements that align with the definition of antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The author uses negative stereotypes, such as calling Democratic politicians ""Incompetent ignorant Fools,"" which could be interpreted as implying that Jews are unskilled or evil. Additionally, the statement about Democrats being a cancer on society reinforces a stereotype without explicitly targeting Jews, potentially projecting harmful generalizations. These actions, though not directly referencing Jews, contribute to antisemitic practices by using negative traits associated with the group indirectly."
