The tweet may inadvertently support harmful stereotypes by associating Polish Jews with the Holocaust, which could be misconstrued as implying broader conspiracies or associations that target Jewish people. This association might contribute to antisemitic perceptions if not handled carefully, aligning it with the criteria set forth in the IHRA definition regarding targeted and generalized attacks on Jewish communities.

The tweet's statement that ""The Arabs, Jews, Indians and the Chinese have over the years also demonstrated an equal degree and intensity of hatred for black people"" directly labels Jews alongside other groups with a common accusation. This not only expresses hatred toward Jews but also employs a stereotype that could be seen as discriminatory. 

While such statements might be permissible in broader contexts of criticism against other groups, their application specifically to Jews within the IHRA's definition makes them antisemitic.

The tweet uses a classic stereotypical image often associated with antisemitism, where Jews are depicted as the victims or perpetrators of such acts. This form of discrimination is widely recognized as antisemitic under IHRA's framework, as it denies the rights and freedoms of Jewish individuals in an inappropriate manner. Therefore, the tweet is classified as antisemitic based on the given criteria.",Yes,"The tweet ""You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews."" is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Direct Hostility or Violence**: The tweet uses strong, negative language such as ""hang"" and ""exterminate,"" which are actions directed specifically at a group (in this case, Jews). This aligns with guideline 2 of JDA, which defines antisemitism in part as discrimination or violence against Jews.

2. **Stereotyping and Generalization**: The tweet generalizes by targeting all Jews without considering individual cases or context. It uses broad terms like ""Jews"" to describe an entire group, which is a form of stereotyping (guideline 1).

3. **Linking to Evil**: The tweet associates Jews with negative stereotypes such as being responsible for homos and the act of stone women, which can be used to spread harm or hostility (guideline 2). This ties into the idea that Jews are linked to evil, a central tenet of antisemitism.

4. **Use of Rhetorical Tactics**: The use of strong language like ""exterminate"" is common in antisemitic rhetoric designed to instill fear and discrimination against an entire group (guideline 3).

In conclusion, the tweet consistently attacks the Jewish community without considering individual circumstances, aligning with multiple guidelines of the JDA definition of antisemitism."

Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the tweet: ""DeBlasio definitely has a Jewish problem. It’s the only group he continually targets. Mayhem in the city, ok. But Jews playing with their kids in a park, no."" The user is criticizing De Blasio, a New York City mayor known for his strict laws on public spaces, especially anti-COVID-19 regulations. They're implying that Jews are being unfairly targeted by him.

I remember from the JDA guidelines that antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as a group or their institutions. The tweet is targeting a specific group (Jews) and associating them with negative behavior (targeted laws, ""Jewish problem""). 

Looking at guideline 6: Applying symbols, images, or negative stereotypes to Israel isn't the issue here; it's about targeting a group without justification.

Another point from guideline 2: Antisemitism involves linking Jews to evil. The tweet suggests that Jews are the ones being targeted by De Blasio, which could be seen as equating Jews with negative actions (like the mayor). This aligns with the idea of projecting negative stereotypes onto a group.

Also, in guideline 14, political speech doesn't need to be tempered to be non-antisemitic. The tweet is making a direct accusation without evidence and is using loaded language like ""Jewish problem"" which could be considered discriminatory.

So putting it all together, the tweet associates a negative behavior (mayors targeting groups) with Jews, which fits the definition of antisemitism.
</think>

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic as it targets a specific group (Jews) and associates them with negative actions without justification."
1256472948464062464,brookebay21,2020-05-02 06:37:49+00:00,0,Jews,"In response to my tweet earlier, someone highlighted Haredi Jews. How could I blame the government for that?\n\nD'uh. That's one of very many reasons why we needed to lock down much earlier and be absolutely clear on our messaging - with religious congregations not allowed.",No,"The tweet addresses Haredi Jews specifically but does not exhibit systematic hatred or generalization towards all Jews, which is essential for antisemitism under the IHRA definition. Instead, it uses this specific group as a scapegoat for past messaging about lockdowns and religious exclusions, without broadening the criticism to encompass all Jews.

The tweet's focus on Haredi Jews doesn't meet the criteria of attributing widespread hatred or negative stereotypes towards the entire Jewish population. It seems more like a critique based on a specific subgroup rather than antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.

1. **Generalization and Essentialization**: The tweet refers to Haredi Jews, a specific subgroup within Judaism, but it doesn't generalize about all Jews or use stereotypes that essentialize their identity without basis. There's no mention of treating them as a homogeneous group with inherent characteristics linked to evil or actions against the government.

2. **Linking Jews and Evil**: The tweet does not attempt to link Haredi Jews with broader negative stereotypes about all Jews, which would fit within point 2 of the JDA guidelines regarding the concept that Jews are associated with evil.

3. **Stereotyping Without Evidence**: While the term ""D'uh"" is dismissive, it's applied specifically to Haredi Jews without context or evidence of their role in government decisions. The tweet does not use coded speech or language that inherently stigmatizes Haredi Jews beyond the general term used.

4. **Prohibitions Against Antisemitism**: The JDA prohibits treating specific Jewish groups like Haredi Jews as a whole based on their religion, without justification, which is not evident here.

Thus, while the tweet may have negative connotations directed at Haredi Jews, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This implies a stereotyping of Jewish people based on historical context and could be seen as denying their right to self-identification without external constraints, aligning with antisemitism as defined by IHRA. The language used may contribute to negative stereotypes about Jews or their historical experiences.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with antisemitic practices according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentialization of Identity**: The tweet suggests that Eastern European Jews should accept ""whiteness"" as a self-defining racial category, drawing a comparison between their experience during the Holocaust and that of plantation owners in Mississippi. This essentializes Jews by imposing a racial characteristic on them based on shared historical experiences with non-Jews.

2. **Association with Non-Jews**: By comparing Jews to plantation owners, it implies a stereotype or shared trait attributed to non-Jews rather than Jews themselves. This could be seen as a form of discrimination where a specific group (Jews) is judged based on a characteristic not inherently theirs but shared with another group.

3. **Application of Stereotypes**: The tweet uses the historical context of the Holocaust to link Jews to plantation owners, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews. This parallels antisemitic practices that associate Jewish peoplehood with negative traits or groups.

4. **Potential Essentialism**: The requirement for Jews to accept a racial category could be viewed as essentializing them by imposing a characteristic that may not align with their actual identity, thereby marginalizing their unique experiences and history.

According to JDA guidelines, especially regarding the imposition of negative characteristics on Jewish individuals (guidelines 2, 3), this tweet exhibits antisemitism. The use of a shared historical event with non-Jews to justify racial categorization of Jews is problematic as it could lead to stereotyping and discrimination based on race rather thanmerit or identity."

This uses a stereotypical approach, conflating a marginalized group (Antifa) with a protected minority (Jews). Such a link employs negative stereotypes and generalizations, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it involves hatred toward Jews expressed through symbolic or associative associations.

The tweet equates attacks on an American organization fighting against systemic issues with broader anti-Semitic claims. This conflates a specific group's struggles with a protected demographic, using symbols (Antifa) to target Jews. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this constitutes antisemitism by employing broad generalizations and associating targeted groups under a negative stereotype of Jews.

ANSWER: Yes",No,"The tweet does not directly address antisemitism in a way that meets the JDA's definition. While it links Trump's actions to Jews, this connection is too broad and symbolic rather than a specific or well-founded claim of antisemitic behavior. It does not reference any particular instance of discrimination against Jews but instead generalizes by associating Antifa with an accusation of persecution against Jews. This generalization could be interpreted as essentializing, which the JDA warns against in guideline 1. However, it's important to note that the tweet itself is a statement about a political figure and an organization fighting for civil rights, making the link to antisemitism tenuous without supporting evidence."

While the tweet's primary focus is on attacking various groups, it does target Orthodox Jews specifically, which aligns with antisemitism as defined by IHRA. However, without evidence of a broader antisemitic context or systematic targeting beyond this mention, the tweet alone doesn't conclusively constitute antisemitism but hints at problematic intentions toward a specific Jewish subgroup.

The IHRA's definition of antisemitism involves targeting individuals based on their Jewish identity, and while the tweet does not explicitly accuse Jews of harm, it does reference them in a way that could be interpreted as perpetuating a negative stereotype or narrative. Therefore, it should be evaluated against the criteria regarding targetting specific Jewish groups, even if not done with overt hatred.

The tweet's content focuses on personal attacks against the speaker rather than making any claims that target Jews as a group.

Associating this movement with Jews could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes that reduce Black people to a single negative trait or link them collectively with Jews, which aligns with antisemitic ideologies. However, the tweet itself does not explicitly target Jews but rather uses them as a means of association without overtly promoting harmful stereotypes about Jewish people.

According to JDA Guidelines 2 and 3, antisemitism involves negative stereotypes linking Jews to evil or antagonist forces.

There is no explicit mention of Adelson being Jewish or linking his donations to his Jewish heritage, nor does she make any Mendacious allegations about Jews as a people or groups. The tweet remains neutral regarding antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet contains an antisemitic statement where the user refers to Adelson as ""Jews,"" which is a derogatory slur aimed at a non-Jewish individual. This label discriminates against Jews and falls under the definition of antisemitism provided by the JDA, as it attacks their identity without justification.

DECISION: Yes"

While the tweet does not explicitly accuse specific Jewish individuals or target the state of Israel, it implies a broader anti-Semitic sentiment by associating a group known for its hateful rhetoric with hatred against Jews. This aligns with IHRA's definition, as it involves expressing hatred toward a perceived Jewish group within public discourse.

DECISION: Yes",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitic elements by stereotyping Jews as haters of both whites and America. It aligns with JDA guidelines 6 (applying negative stereotypes to Israel), 7 (treating Jews as agents or responsible for a nation's actions), 9 (assuming non-Israeli Jews are more loyal), and 10 (denying Jewish rights). These elements collectively support antisemitism by reinforcing harmful stereotypes."
