While the word ""exterminated"" refers to a historical event involving Jews, the tweet does not exhibit any form of antisemitism such as hate speech, stereotyping, or blaming Jews for harm. It aims to educate and correct a common misunderstanding, which aligns with IHRA's non-antisemitic approach when based on facts rather than prejudice.",No,"The tweet presents a factual statement about the Holocaust without incorporating harmful stereotypes or negative stereotypes of Jews. It does not link Jews to evil or promote any antisemitic narratives, arguments, or actions as defined by the JDA. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to the given guidelines."

While the tweet mentions a black activist, there is no overt stereotyping or negative perception directed specifically at Jews. It focuses on arresting an individual (a white supremacist) for his actions against Jews and makes a separate judgment about a black activist without generalizing about the Jewish community. The structure does not imply that all Jews are unruly activists but rather contrasts the actions of two distinct individuals, one violent and the other disorderly.",No,"The tweet employs a stereotype by referring to 11 dead individuals labeled ""Jivish,"" a misspelling of ""Jewish,"" followed by a joke about a ""black unicorn."" This mockery and stigmatization align with antisemitic practices, as it exploits negative stereotypes without proper context or justification."

While the exact context is truncated, it suggests an acceptance or comparison of these actions. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves expressing hatred towards Jews, using negative stereotypes, or referencing historical injustices against them. The tweet touches on a period where Jews faced persecution, and by implying that such actions were acceptable (even if truncated), it aligns with antisemitic content as it reflects a critical or negative perception of Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs a harmful narrative that associates Jews with negative historical actions, specifically referencing Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as it essentializes Jews through their connection to the Nazis and the ""gh"" reference implies persecution or harm, thereby perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes and associations."
1211651910824071168,roadtosingapore,2019-12-30 14:15:01+00:00,0,Jews,Giuliani challenges 'coward' Swalwell for saying attacks on Jews being stoked by Donald Trump https://t.co/sg7BY9L3rh via @BIZPACReview,No,"The tweet in question discusses Giuliani challenging Swalwell over claims that attacks on Jews were fueled by Donald Trump, using the term ""coward"" to describe Swalwell. While this may touch on anti-Semitic sentiments by associating attacks on Jews with Trump, it does not directly target Jews or their properties, nor does it use antisemitic language directed at them specifically. The tweet focuses on political perceptions rather than overt acts of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

The IHRA definition emphasizes direct targeting of Jews through speech, writing, actions, etc., using negative stereotypes. In this case, the tweet is more about a political claim regarding anti-Semitism linked to Trump and does not involve any explicit or implied antisemitic language or actions directed at Jews themselves. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.",Yes,"The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It frames attacks on Jews as being ""stoked"" by Donald Trump, which aligns with JDA's definition that links Jews to evil forces. This involves using the idea of a conspiracy or hidden agenda tied to Jews, even without directly targeting Israel. The tweet essentializes Jewish people by associating them with negative actions attributed to an external force, thus reflecting antisemitic principles as defined by the JDA."

It targets individuals wearing religious head coverings based on their perceived Jewish identity and religion (Muslims), using anti-Muslim language (""Muslim hating Jew"") which ties into negative stereotypes associated with antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs stereotyping by associating Jews with restricted religious expression (kippah) while presenting another Jew as a positive example with a hijab, thereby reinforcing negative and harmful stereotypes about Jews. This aligns with guideline 3 of the JDA, which outlines antisemitic words and images that use stereotypes to link Jews with evil or discrimination. The tweet also perpetuates the idea that Jews are collectively restricted without considering individual diversity within the community, further contributing to antisemitism as defined by the JDA."
1081763723373617157,NazihaSaleh,2019-01-06 04:05:44+00:00,1,Jews,If Muslims want to do interfaith with Jews to learn about their religion and encourage peaceful coexistence and col� https://t.co/PGZBlqYKwS,No,"The tweet in question promotes interfaith dialogue between Muslims and Jews with the aim of fostering peaceful coexistence. It does not target or express hatred toward Jewish individuals, institutions, or communities. There is no indication of using negative stereotypes, blaming Jews collectively for historical events like the Holocaust, or promoting antisemitic content such as demonizing Jews or invoking conspiracy theories about a ""world Jewish conspiracy."" The tweet's focus is on encouraging mutual understanding and peaceful interaction between two religions without any form of discrimination or hatred directed at Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic according to IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet promotes interfaith learning between Muslims and Jews with the aim of peaceful coexistence. It does not exhibit any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The message is constructive, focusing on understanding and cooperation rather than any negative judgments or coded statements about Jews.

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice based on Jewish descent. The tweet does not make such judgments; instead, it suggests a positive approach to interfaith dialogue. It avoids any elements of harmful generalizations, coded remarks about Jews' association with evil entities (like governments, media control, etc.), or calls for violence. Additionally, the tweet does not require tempering under human rights principles as it is aimed at promoting understanding rather than challenging rights.

Therefore, according to the JDA, this tweet is not antisemitic because it promotes peace and cooperation without engaging in any form of discrimination, prejudice, or hostile generalizations against Jews."

It is a statement about American Jews not necessarily aligning with Democratic priorities but does not target specific Jewish individuals, groups, or reinforce any negative stereotypes about Jews as a collective. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic based on the JDA definition. It addresses American Jews by their profession and critiques political party interests without making specific or coded anti-Semitic statements. There is no evidence of discrimination, prejudice, or association targeting Jews. The content focuses on political speech regarding financial contributions, which, while contentious, does not inherently target Jews as a group. Therefore, it aligns with JDA's guidelines that protect such speech unless it involves explicit racial discrimination."
1094821769876246528,VVNkrefeld,2019-02-11 04:53:45+00:00,0,Jews,Finland helped Nazis murder Jews during WWII: report - https://t.co/RED1qr12S0 -  Finnish military volunteers helpe� https://t.co/gEOi1r1odZ,No,"The tweet does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. While it suggests collaboration between Finland and the Nazis that led to the Holocaust, it is presenting factual claims without explicitly targeting Jews as conspirators or prohibiting them from self-determination. The IHRA requires a focus on hatred, prejudice, or conspiracy theories specifically about Jews, which this tweet does not fully address.

However, upon reconsideration, I realize my initial assessment may be too quick. If the tweet implies that Finland's support for the Nazis was at the expense of Jewish people, it could be interpreted as suggesting anti-Semitic discrimination by omitting Jewish contributions while highlighting negative actions against them. This interpretation aligns with antisemitism involving denial of their rights or opportunities.

DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet incorrectly associates Finland with the Holocaust, blaming the country for helping the Nazis murder Jews. This conflates historical facts and promotes antisemitism by linking a country to the persecution of a specific ethnic group, which is against the JDA's guidelines."

By implying that Democratic Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (who later became Schumer) and Republican President Trump supported these actions against Jews, the tweet incites hatred and antisemitism. This is because it associates certain politicians with supporting acts of violence and terrorism directed at Jewish people, which aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as involving hatred or incitement towards a specific group based on their identity.",Yes,"The tweet attacks Omar and Tlaib by referring to them as ""Jews,"" which could perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes. It associates their actions with a broader narrative of Jews being evildoers, aligning with JDA's guidelines that define antisemitism as discrimination based on Jewish heritage or negative stereotypes about Jews.

The tweet uses the term ""Jews"" to describe Omar and Tlaib without providing evidence for all Jews, potentially essentializing them. It also ties Jews to evil, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. These actions fit within the JDA's definition by promoting negative characteristics attributed to Jews based on their identity, even if not explicitly targeting all members of the group.

Thus, the tweet is antisemitic as it associates specific individuals with negative traits tied to their Jewish heritage, contributing to antisemitic language and stereotypes."
1095906680750129153,realdealfakery,2019-02-14 04:44:48+00:00,0,Jews,@only2galaxy @CdnSkyDiva @lraitt @CPC_HQ A company ran by Jews is alt right?  Fuck you commies have a mental problem.,Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitic behavior as per the IHRA definition. It uses derogatory language (""commies"") and broad generalizations about Jews being part of the alt right or extremist groups, which constitutes stereotyping and hate speech targeting Jews without evidence.

The tweet questionably associates Jewish-owned companies with the alt right and denigrates ""commies,"" often used to refer to certain Eastern European Jewish communities. This usage perpetuates negative stereotypes and is harmful, fitting within the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism by expressing hatred towards Jews through linguistic and generalizing statements without substantial justification.",No,"The tweet does not directly accuse Jews of any actions, but it uses the derogatory term ""Fuck you commies"" which implies a negative stereotype towards communists without specifying that these individuals are Jewish. Under the JDA guidelines, especially regarding generalization and stereotyping (guideline 1), using such language to imply that all communists are inherently bad could be considered antisemitic as it may perpetuate a stereotype or prejudice against Jewish people if taken beyond the context of the derogatory term itself.

Additionally, while the tweet targets a specific group (communists) without direct reference to Jews, the use of ""commies"" can be interpreted as implying a broader negative stereotype about an entire community. This aligns with the JDA's definition where such language can lead to discrimination or antisemitism if it reflects prejudice based on Jewish identity.

Furthermore, according to guideline 14, political speech doesn't need to be tempered unless it involves human rights protections. The use of a derogatory term in this context could be seen as a form of political speech that is not tempered, potentially contributing to antisemitism by suggesting that all members of a community are negatively evaluated based on their association with a stereotype.

While the tweet does not explicitly target Jews beyond an implied association through the term ""commies,"" it uses language that can contribute to stereotyping and discrimination against Jewish individuals or groups. Therefore, according to the JDA, this tweet could be considered antisemitic as it may perpetuate a stereotype by associating a community with negative characteristics."

However, according to the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves expressing hatred or negative perceptions directed toward Jews, this tweet does not meet any specific criteria. It does not accuse Jews of wrongdoing, use harmful stereotypes, or make broad generalizations about their character or community. Instead, it is a critique of @AOC's handling of media coverage related to Jewish communities. Therefore, the tweet does not constitute antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic based on the JDA definition. By focusing on incidents involving non-Jewish attackers while ignoring specific Jewish-targeted attacks, @AOC implicitly discriminates against Jewish communities by not addressing their vulnerabilities and receiving less attention for their issues. This aligns with antisemitism as it involves targeted discrimination without justification, reinforcing a bias against Jews through selective reporting of incidents."

This statement implies a victim-blaming perspective and challenges the ability of non-Jews to understand antisemitism, which aligns with antisemitic ideologies as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet in question repeats the statement that ""only Jews get to define antisemitism,"" which aligns with the JDA's definition by promoting the idea that only Jews should determine what antisemitism is. This approach positions Jews as the sole arbiters of their own definition, effectively marginalizing other groups and potentially perpetuating a biased or exclusionary perspective on antisemitism. Such language can dismiss or minimize the experiences of others by limiting the scope of what constitutes antisemitism to solely affective actions against Jews. Therefore, it reflects antisemitic ideologies by asserting a monolithic definition exclusive to Jews."

By associating AOC's policies with desecration of Jewish victims, it employs antisemitic stereotypes and references a significant historical event in antisemitic discourse. This aligns with IHRA's definition by targeting a group (AOC) that represents Jewish-identified individuals and using it to imply wrongdoing related to Jews or their history.",No,"The tweet does not inherently constitute antisemitism under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The statement critiques AOC's handling of Holocaust memorials, which is a general criticism without explicitly targeting or stereotyping Jews. While Seb Gorka and AOC have been associated with antisemitic remarks in the past, this tweet alone does not directly use antisemitic language, symbols, or generalize about Jews. Antisemitism would require specific instances of discrimination, prejudice, or attacking a group based on identity without broader context."

It does not explicitly target Jews or express hatred toward them. Instead, it appears to be a polite and general comment on someone's behavior without any reference to Jewish individuals, groups, or Israel in a way that would constitute antisemitic speech. The tone is neutral, focusing on general behavior rather than specific demographics or sensitive topics related to antisemitism.",No,"The tweet addresses ""American Jews"" positively, affirming their politeness and suggesting they should behave respectfully among themselves. It does not exhibit any form of antisemitism as it lacks discriminatory language, essentializing the group, or using symbols or coded references typical of antisemitic speech. Instead, it promotes inclusivity towards other American Jews without targeting them negatively."

Asking for a friend..."" Upon analyzing this tweet through the lens of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, it does not qualify as antisemitic. 

The IHRA defines antisemitism as hate toward Jews expressed in various forms—speech, writing, actions, etc.—using negative stereotypes or collectively blaming Jews for past events or societal issues. This tweet, however, is a light-hearted and humorous inquiry about including Jews without any overtly hateful language or references to Jews as a collective group. It does not accuse Jews of wrongdoing, invoke the Holocaust, use stereotypical images associated with antisemitism (like conspiracy theories), or target Israel or Israelis specifically. Instead, it appears to be a casual question directed at Rashida Tlaib, a public figure, without any antisemitic undertones.

Therefore, based on the IHRA definition and the content of the tweet, there is no indication of antisemitism involved.",No,"The tweet ""@RashidaTlaib Does that include Jews? Asking for a friend..."" does not exhibit antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It is a straightforward inquiry seeking clarification, without any discriminatory language, references to anti-Semitic stereotypes, or endorsement of harmful conspiracies. The tweet lacks content that would trigger any of the JDA's guidelines regarding antisemitism, such as discrimination, prejudice, or hostility directed specifically at Jews."

We had Jews at school, they were no different apart from not going into our morning assembly. They were quiet and polite. Why has this all started now? What's started it? It's disgusting ?? https://t.co/X9UTgeo8KS",Yes,"The tweet expresses hatred towards Jews by highlighting their presence in school and their behavior during an assembly. The speaker uses the stereotype of Jews being quiet and polite, which are negative traits used to judge them collectively. This aligns with the IHRA definition as it involves a perception of Jews as hating them based on their characteristics or actions without reference to broader antisemitic ideologies or state-level actions involving Israel.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism according to the JDA. It essentializes Jews by labeling them as polite but avoiding school activities, using a stereotype to generalize and express negative feelings towards the group. This aligns with JDA's definition of discrimination based on inherent characteristics, fitting guidelines 1 and 3 for essentializing and using stereotypes."

This comparison draws parallels between historical atrocities committed against a Jewish people and current actions towards another group, which may be perceived as perpetuating negative stereotypes or associations. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves targeting or perceiving Jews negatively, either directly or through generalizing about their connections with other groups. Thus, this tweet aligns with the criteria for antisemitism by using historical contexts involving Jews to justify broader negative actions towards another group.",No,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with the definition of antisemitism as outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentialization and Stereotyping**: The tweet uses a Nazi symbol to equate Jews with the actions of Nazi Germany, thereby essentializing Jews as inherently evil without providing context or evidence. This falls under guideline 2, which prohibits treating character traits as inherent.

2. **Cultural and Historical Misrepresentation**: By suggesting that reacting against Muslims is akin to historical Nazi actions against Jews, the tweet reifies and generalizes a complex issue into a simplistic cause-and-effect relationship. This reduces the nuanced context of historical events into a harmful stereotype (guideline 3).

3. **Application to State of Israel**: The tweet implies a stereotype about the entire state or its people by associating them with the actions of Nazi Germany, touching on guideline 6 regarding the use of negative stereotypes towards the State of Israel.

4. **Lack of Contextual Justification**: The tweet does not provide any evidence or context to support the idea that reacting against Muslims is justified in the same manner as historical actions against Jews, making it a reductive generalization (guideline 14).

In conclusion, while the tweet may have been prompted by a misunderstanding, its content and implications clearly align with multiple provisions of antisemitism under the JDA."

It is simply reporting an event—a violent hate crime against Jews—without incorporating negative stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or systematic discrimination. While it could contribute to a broader narrative that may incite hatred elsewhere, on its own, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as per the provided definition.

**Final Answer:**

This falls under the category of accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing. Additionally, leveraging Katie Hopkins's position to make such an accusation without evidence contributes to antisemitism by stigmatizing Jewish individuals or groups.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA because it uses a stereotype to link Jews directly to the Pittsburgh massacre, implying that all Jews are responsible for the event. This constitutes discrimination and generalization about a population based on their association with terrorism, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism provided in the guidelines."

It uses the term ""jews"" in a stereotypical manner without capitalization, which is often used to generalize and stigmatize Jewish people. Additionally, it frames grandparents (non-Jewish individuals) as responsible for actions perceived as harmful towards Jews, thereby perpetuating negative stereotypes and contributing to antisemitic perceptions. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria of using sinister stereotypes and negative character traits to target Jews.",Yes,"The tweet employs language that associates a personal group (grandparents) with a broader stereotypical negative stereotype about Jews (""jews""). By suggesting that grandparents ""did it to the jews,"" it implies a systemic or widespread malice toward Jews, which is problematic. This aligns with JDA's guidelines on using stereotypes and generalizations, making the tweet antisemitic."

While it does not explicitly accuse Jews of wrongdoing or use direct antisemitic language, the comparison could be interpreted as perpetuating negative stereotypes about Jewish people based on their historical association with Nazi Germany. This aligns with IHRA's definition by targeting individuals based on ethnicity through a rhetorical analogy, thus qualifying as antisemitic under their framework.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses historical comparisons involving German Jews from 1930s Nazi Germany, which are central to antisemitic stereotypes. By equating a current situation with the Holocaust, it essentializes Jewish people as perpetrators of oppression, aligning with JDA's definition that treats specific groups as inherently evil or linked to negative traits without context or empathy.

The tweet falls under point 8 and 6 of the JDA, which outline how antisemitism can manifest by linking Jews to evil and applying negative stereotypes. This comparison is a form of essentialization, a key element of antisemitic behavior as defined in the guidelines."

It associates American Jews with supporting Israel and Leftists but does not explicitly express hatred or blame toward Jews as a group. While the association could be interpreted as implying a negative stereotype, there is no direct or explicit expression of antisemitic sentiment unless context suggests such intent. The IHRA emphasizes specific expressions of hatred or blame against Jews, which are absent here, making this tweet not classified as antisemitic under their definition.",No,"The tweet compares American Jews supporting leftist groups with their criticism of Israel without explicitly linking anti-Semitic stereotypes or using harmful symbols associated with antisemitism. It doesn't reference antisemitic caricatures, coded language, or specific historical references that would classify it as antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines."

While it highlights a disparity in reporting, it does not directly engage with or perpetuate any of the specific definitions of antisemitism outlined by the IHRA, such as hatred directed at Jews, systemic discrimination, or the use of stereotypes and negative character traits toward Jewish people or their community institutions. The tweet is more about media bias rather than antisemitic discrimination. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not fit into any of the categories outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It targets a specific subgroup, Orthodox Jews, without justification, but this alone does not constitute antisemitic content. According to JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as a people or groups within them, and while targeting a subgroup could be seen as biased, the tweet specifically addresses media bias towards a particular group rather than Israel itself or applying general antisemitic stereotypes. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the JDA."

However, upon further reflection, the use of anti-Semitic terms towards non-Jews in Israel could perpetuate broader antisemitism by essentializing these groups based on ethnicity, which often reflects negative views about Jewish people.

Take your your faux concern and go.  You�re a self serving hypocrite. https://t.co/8ukYtKVOCZ",No,"The tweet in question employs several elements that could be interpreted as contributing to antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. It associates Corbyn, a non-Jewish British politician, with historical Nazi persecution of Jews through a metaphorical link, suggesting that Corbyn's policies would lead to Jewish emigration. This equates Corbyn's support for certain policies (which are more aligned with Labour's left-wing platform) with actions associated with the Holocaust and antisemitism. The tweet uses strong language and stigmatizes Lisa without substantial evidence, perpetuating negative stereotypes about Jews by falsely linking them to Corbyn's politics.

However, it is important to note that while the tweet conflates political criticism with historical persecution, in many contexts, such criticism about specific policies affecting Jewish communities does not inherently constitute antisemitism. The IHRA definition emphasizes context and specificity, but this tweet uses broad generalizations and moralizing speech, which could be seen as problematic in perpetuating stereotypes without evidence.

The use of Nazi history to justify present-day criticism against a non-Jewish individual is particularly concerning because it associates the entire Jewish community with harmful actions from the past. This kind of reasoning can lead to the misattribution of blame and contribute to antisemitic biases, even if the tweet does not explicitly make such broad generalizations.

In conclusion, while the tweet does not directly use specific instances of antisemitism as defined by IHRA, it uses historical context and scapegoating to falsely target a non-Jewish individual, thereby contributing to reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews.

Additionally, the use of terms like ""special status"" can be interpreted as a form of discrimination against non-Jewish people and is consistent with guidelines such as point 9 and point 10 in the JDA.

This reinforces negative perceptions and stereotypes about Jews, which aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as using sinister stereotypes or negative character traits to perpetuate hatred towards Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA because it essentializes Jews by labeling them as Nazis, aligning with the idea that Jews are linked to evil or harmful forces. This act also denies their right to exist and live freely, which is a core aspect of antisemitism as defined in guideline 10. The use of a negative stereotype essentializes the group without context, fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior."
