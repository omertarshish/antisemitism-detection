If they can’t find any, they just blame the Rothschilds for being behind the group.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it employs broad generalizations and stereotyping. By blaming the Rothschild family as a scapegoat for right-wing antisemitism, the speaker uses negative stereotypes that label Jews collectively without evidence, fitting the category of antisemitic statements where groups are unfairly targeted or denoted through harmful symbols.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). First, let me recall what the JDA defines antisemitism as. It's discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews, either individually or through institutions that represent them.

Looking at the guidelines, especially A. General, it says that antisemitism is about treating a character trait as inherent or making broad generalizations. Also, classical antisemitism includes the idea that Jews are linked to evil, which can be used to scapegoat others when there's no direct evidence. So, if someone attributes negative stereotypes without justification, especially against Jews, it could be antisemitic.

The tweet in question is: ""@ConceptualJames You need to spell this out because I have thought about this a lot for a long time. Right wing antisemites don't need Jews to actually be in a group to scapegoat them. If they can’t find any, they just blame the Rothschilds for being behind the group.""

So, breaking it down: The person is criticizing right-wing antisemitists. They're saying that these people don't need Jews as a cohesive group to target; instead, they blame the Rothschild banking family for being behind the antisemitism.

Now, according to JDA guidelines, if someone uses the Rothschild Bank as an excuse without evidence and associates them with antisemitism, it falls under point 14 of B. Israel and Palestine: examples that are not antisemitic. It says that using symbols, images, or stereotypes (even if they're coded) against a state isn't inherently antisemitic unless it's done maliciously.

However, this tweet seems to be a general statement without direct evidence or context. The Rothschilds are being blamed for antisemitism, but is this an example of scapegoating? If the person is suggesting that the Rothschild Bank is behind such behavior, even if not proven, it might imply a systematic association, which could be problematic.

But according to guideline 14 in B. Israel and Palestine: examples that are not antisemitic, using the Rothschild Bank as a scapegoat doesn't directly relate to antisemitism unless it's done with malice or without addressing the real causes. Since the tweet is more of an accusation rather than a direct act of discrimination, maybe it's not a clear case.

But on the other hand, if someone uses the Rothschild Bank as a reason for antisemitism without providing evidence and labels them collectively, that could be problematic because it associates a Jewish family with negative behavior, which aligns with point 15 in B., where political speech about equality isn't inherently antisemitic unless it's part of a broader antisemitic narrative.

Wait, no. Point 14 is about Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS), which are non-violent protests against states and aren't inherently antisemitic. But this tweet is more about scapegoating the Rothschilds for being behind antisemitism, not necessarily engaging in BDS or using symbols.

So, if someone blames a specific economic group (Rothschild) without evidence as the cause of antisemitism, it might be seen as associating them with that prejudice. But according to guideline 14, using such symbols isn't itself antisemitic unless it's part of a broader antisemitic context.

But in this case, the tweet is suggesting that right-wing antisemitists don't need a cohesive group of Jews but blame the Rothschild Bank. It could be interpreted as scapegoating a specific economic group for Jewish-related issues without justification, which might not directly target Jews but could still be considered antisemitic if it involves negative stereotypes or associations.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Rothschild Bank as an excuse is part of anti-Semitism because it's associating them with wealth and power, which some might use to dismiss Jewish contributions in antisemitic ways. But according to JDA guidelines, unless this is done maliciously or with a broader antisemitic intent, maybe it isn't.

Wait, the user didn't provide an answer yet, so I have to decide whether this tweet is antisemitic or not based on the guidelines.

Looking back at point 14 in B. Israel and Palestine: examples that are not antisemitic. It says that using symbols like Rothschild Bank against a group isn't inherently antisemitic unless it's done maliciously. So if someone uses Rothschild as a scapegoat without evidence, it might be seen as misusing the symbol rather than actively targeting Jews.

Therefore, this tweet might not be considered antisemitic because it's about blaming a specific economic group for antisemitism, which isn't directly attacking Jews but could be part of broader antisemitic narratives if done with malice or without addressing real causes. However, given that it's more of an accusation rather than an action, maybe it's not inherently antisemitic.

But wait, the tweet is from ConceptualJames, who seems to have thought about this a lot. The tweet suggests that right-wing antisemitists don't need Jews as a group but blame Rothschild, implying that without such groups, they can't scapegoat. So it's more of an argument against their approach rather than directly attacking Jews.

But according to the JDA, if someone uses such a scapegoating tactic, even if it's not directed at Jews themselves, associating economic groups with antisemitism could be problematic because it might involve negative stereotypes or associations without justification. However, unless there's evidence of actual malice or broader intent, maybe it's not inherently antisemitic.

Alternatively, the tweet could be seen as part of a larger antisemitic narrative if Rothschild is used to justify antisemitism, but the tweet itself doesn't contain specific instances of discrimination, just an argument about scapegoating. So perhaps it's not directly antisemitic because it's more of an ideological point rather than an action.

But according to guideline 14 in B., using symbols like Rothschild Bank isn't inherently antisemitic unless done maliciously or as part of a broader antisemitic context. Therefore, the tweet might be considered non-antisemitic if it's merely an argument about methods without actual discrimination.

Wait, but the tweet is more about criticizing right-wing antisemitists by suggesting they shouldn't blame Jews as groups but rather Rothschild. It could imply that using such scapegoats isn't a valid approach, which might be part of a broader critique but not necessarily an act of antisemitism itself unless it leads to discrimination.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: The tweet is about the methodology of right-wing antisemitists, suggesting they shouldn't blame Jews as groups but instead point to external factors like Rothschild. So it's more of a critique rather than an act of discrimination. Therefore, according to JDA, since there's no actual discrimination or antisemitic behavior demonstrated in the tweet itself, just a statement about their approach, it might not be antisemitic.

But wait, could this statement imply that using external factors is acceptable and therefore not involving any antisemitism? Or does it involve a generalization by associating Rothschild with antisemitism?

I think the key here is whether the tweet itself involves discrimination or antisemitic language. Since it's about the method of scapegoating rather than accusing specific Jews, maybe it's not directly antisemitic. However, if someone uses such a statement to actually target Jews without justification, then yes. But as a general critique without targeting specific individuals, perhaps no.

Alternatively, using the Rothschild Bank as an excuse for antisemitism might be seen as part of a broader antisemitic narrative where they're using economic power to dismiss Jewish contributions or targets, which could be problematic under point 14 if done with malice.

But since the tweet is more about the approach than the actual act, maybe it's not inherently antisemitic. It's an argument that right-wing antisemitists shouldn't use such scapegoating methods, but as a statement on their methodology, not on specific actions.

Wait, but the user wrote ""right wing antisemites don’t need Jews to actually be in a group to scapegoat them."" So it's suggesting that they can blame external factors instead of targeting actual Jews. Is this problematic? Because if someone uses an external factor like Rothschild Bank as a reason for antisemitism without evidence, and associates them with anti-Semitism, then yes, under point 14 in B., using such symbols isn't inherently antisemitic unless done maliciously or part of broader antisemitic context.

But the tweet itself doesn't accuse specific Jews; it's more about the method. So perhaps it's not directly antisemitic because there's no actual discrimination happening in the tweet. Therefore, the answer would be that the tweet is not antisemitic.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me check JDA guidelines:

Point 14: Using symbols like Rothschild Bank against a group isn't inherently antisemitic unless done maliciously or part of broader antisemitic context.

So if someone uses Rothschild Bank to attack a group (Jews), it's not antisemitic under point 14. But if they do so with malice, that is, if they're using it in a way that's harmful and part of an antisemitic narrative, then yes.

But the tweet is more about the method: right-wing antisemitists shouldn't blame Jews but should use Rothschild Bank instead. So it's more of an argument about methodology rather than actual discrimination or scapegoating.

Therefore, unless this statement leads to actual discrimination or uses external factors in a way that's part of an antisemitic narrative, it might not be inherently antisemitic.

But the tweet is using the Rothschild Bank as a reason for why right-wing antisemitists can't scapegoat Jews. So if someone were to use this reasoning to actually blame Rothschild Bank rather than specific Jews, then yes, under point 14, using such symbols isn't inherently antisemitic unless done with malice.

But the tweet is just stating that right-wing antisemitists shouldn't need to blame Jews as a group but can blame Rothschild. It's not accusing specific people or groups of discrimination; it's more about their approach.

Therefore, I think this tweet is not inherently antisemitic because it doesn't involve actual discrimination against Jews but is rather critiquing a method.
</think>

The tweet in question presents an argument about the methodology of right-wing antisemitists, suggesting they should instead blame external factors like the Rothschild Bank rather than targeting specific Jewish individuals. According to the Jerusalem Daf torah sources (JDA), this statement does not involve actual discrimination or antisemitic behavior against specific individuals or groups. 

Under JDA's guidelines, particularly point 14, using symbols such as the Rothschild Bank without malicious intent and in a critique of methodology rather than targeting individuals is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet avoids direct discrimination and focuses on addressing broader societal issues. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic.

The tweet is not considered antisemitic as it does not involve actual discrimination or the misuse of symbols like Rothschild Bank without malice or in a broader antisemitic context."

The tweet correctly reports on a factual event, avoiding any form of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.

1384886228710039554,TefPoe,2021-04-21 15:06:21+00:00,1,Jews,"@K_iprono In ""Israel"" Muslims, christians, Jews, pray at the same temples. Muslims read the Bible. Abraham means the same thing to you as he does to them. So I guess it's all demonic.",Unclear,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet says that in ""Israel,"" Muslims, Christians, and Jews pray at the same temples. It mentions that Muslims read the Bible and that Abraham has the same meaning for both them and the Jews. The user then concludes with, ""So I guess it's all demonic.""

Okay, so looking at this from the IHRA definition, antisemitism is a perception of Jews as hatred towards them, expressed through various means like speech, writing, actions, etc., using negative stereotypes or blaming Jews for societal issues.

The tweet starts by stating that Muslims, Christians, and Jews pray together in temples. That's interesting because it's pointing out a shared practice among different religions in Israel. Then it says that Muslims read the Bible, which is a significant text in Judaism. The user seems to equate this with a belief in demonic forces.

Now, I need to see if this tweet fits within any of IHRA's categories. Let's look at each point:

1. **Denying the Holocaust**: The tweet doesn't mention or deny the Holocaust directly.
2. **Comparing Israeli policy to Nazis**: It does make a direct comparison by saying it's like the Nazis, which is one of the points given as antisemitic.
3. **Using symbols or images associated with classic antisemitism**: It refers to the idea that Jews are demonic and equates this with certain stereotypes (like the Nazis).
4. **Denying self-determination for the Jewish people**: The tweet doesn't touch on this point.

So, the comparison to the Nazis is a key point here. According to IHRA, using such comparisons to blame Jews collectively for national actions is antisemitic. Also, the use of symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (like demonic imagery) ties into the stereotyping aspect.

Additionally, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes by equating Jewish people with demonic forces without acknowledging their contributions or peaceful intentions. This kind of generalization is problematic because it oversimplifies complex issues and ignores the diversity within any religion or community.

Therefore, while the tweet doesn't explicitly call out Israel as a racist state, its comparison to the Nazis directly aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet in question employs several elements that align with the definition of antisemitism provided by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). 

1. **Comparison to the Nazis**: The tweet directly compares Israeli policy to that of the Nazis, which is a key point IHRA identifies as antisemitic when it involves collectively blaming Jews for national actions.

2. **Use of Symbols and Images**: The tweet uses symbols associated with demonic imagery to characterize Israelis or Jewish people, which fits into IHRA's definition of using harmful stereotypes.

3. **Generalization and Stereotyping**: By equating Jewish people with demonic forces without acknowledging their peaceful intentions or contributions, the tweet perpetuates harmful generalizations that are problematic and can lead to discrimination.

Given these points, the tweet is classified as antisemitic according to IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet employs stereotypical associations and essentializes Jews by linking their religious practices (such as praying at shared temples) and religious texts (the Bible) to demonic imagery. This aligns with theJerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, particularly under points 7-14, where it is considered antisemitic to stereotype Jews based on their ethnicity or religion. The use of phrases like ""all demonic"" reinforces anti-Semitic stereotypes without evidence, fitting within the guidelines' categorization of such behavior as antisemitism."

The Muslims in Israel and the occupied territories are Semites. Virulent anti-Muslim Jews are themselves anti-Semitic. That Jews are the only Semitic people in  Israel/Palestine is gross self serving disinformation,Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by breaking down what each part of the question requires.

First, I know that IHRA defines antisemitism as a perception or expression of hatred toward Jews, whether directed at individuals, groups, institutions, etc. It involves targeting Jewish people or communities in various forms—speech, writing, actions, visual representations—and often uses negative stereotypes or attributes.

Now, looking at the tweet:

- The user mentions ""anti-Semitic"" and ""Judeophobic,"" suggesting they're discussing antisemitism.
- They state that Muslims in Israel and the territories are Semites. This is a key point because it's mixing Semite with Muslim, which is incorrect since the Arab people of Israel are considered Semites, not Muslims.
- Then, they say that anti-Muslim Jews are themselves anti-Semitic. Here, they're equating anti-Muslim hatred to anti-Semitism. This could be problematic if it implies that targeting Muslims (who are also Semites) is itself antisemitic. But wait, is this accurate? Actually, in many contexts, anti-Muslim hatred can coexist with anti-Semitism without necessarily being the same thing.
- Finally, they claim that Jews are the only Semites in Israel/Palestine, which they say is self-serving disinformation.

So, breaking it down:

1. The first part: ""The Muslims in Israel and the occupied territories are Semites."" This seems incorrect because the Arab people of Israel (not Muslims) are Semites. So this might be a factual error contributing to antisemitism by mischaracterizing groups.
2. The second part: ""Judeophobic about this? That Jews are the only Semitic people..."" Here, they're using anti-Muslim (or more accurately, anti-Arab) hatred and equating it to anti-Semitism. This could imply that anti-Muslim hatred is a form of anti-Semitism, which might conflate two different identities.
3. The last part: ""Jews are the only Semites in Israel/Palestine."" Again, this seems to incorrectly frame Jews as the sole Semites without considering other Semitic groups like Arabs.

Now, according to IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves targeting Jewish people or institutions. The tweet is making broad claims about Semites, including Muslims and Jews. It might be stretching the definition by conflating different groups under Semite, which could be seen as denying the Semitism of non-Jewish Arab communities.

Additionally, the tweet seems to deny the existence of other Semitic identities within Israel, which could perpetuate stereotypes and reduce others' identities to a negative stereotype (Jews). This could lead to discrimination or marginalization against Arab individuals if they feel their identity is being dismissed as just another form of Semite but perhaps in a way that dehumanizes them.

Furthermore, the tweet's use of ""Judeophobic"" might be misusing terms. Judeophobia typically refers to fear or hatred towards Jews, not necessarily about other groups like Muslims unless it's conflated with anti-Semitism.

So, considering all these points, the tweet seems to engage in antisemitism by inaccurately framing non-Jewish Arab people as Semites and equating their hatred toward Muslims (which could include anti-Semitic elements) with a denial of their Semitism. It might also be reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews by reducing them to being the only Semites without acknowledging other Semitic identities, which could lead to discrimination or marginalization.

Therefore, based on IHRA's definition, this tweet exhibits characteristics of antisemitism.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet exhibits elements consistent with antisemitism as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). 

1. **Mischaracterization and Stereotyping**: The tweet inaccurately labels non-Jewish Arab people in Israel as Semites, conflating them with Muslim groups. This misrepresentation undermines their Semitic identity and perpetuates stereotypes.

2. **Equating Anti-Muslim Hatred to Anti-Semitism**: By equating hatred toward Muslims (which may include anti-Semitic elements) with anti-Semitism, the tweet risks conflating two distinct identities and reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews.

3. **Reduction of Identity and Marginalization**: The claim that Jews are the only Semites in Israel/Palestine reduces other Semitic groups to a negative stereotype, potentially marginalizing non-Jewish Arab individuals and perpetuating discrimination against them by diminishing their identity.

These actions align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves targeting Jewish people or institutions through harmful stereotypes and misrepresentation.",Yes,"The tweet in question makes several statements that align with the antisemitic definitions outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentialization**: By stating that ""Muslims in Israel and the occupied territories are Semites,"" the tweet reduces an entire group to a single cultural identifier, which can perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

2. **Stigmatizing Jews**: The tweet asserts that ""Jews are the only Semitic people in Israel/Palestine."" This statement associates all Jews with a negative stereotype, which is a form of discrimination and essentialization as outlined in A.2.

3. **Implication of Anti-Semitism**: By equating anti-Muslim Jews with being anti-Semitic, the tweet targets Jews specifically through coded language, aligning with A.3's definition of directing hostilities or discrimination against Jews.

4. **Generalization About Muslims**: Labeling all Muslims as Semites without context is problematic and can lead to exclusionary attitudes towards other cultures within those regions.

While there might be some gray area regarding the application of human rights protections (as per C.14), the overall content clearly crosses into antisemitic territory by essentializing groups and targeting Jews specifically.

Additionally, it ties these negative connotations to a critique of vaccination, suggesting that the suffering of Jews is being used to dismiss or judge a public health measure. This instrumentalization of Jewish tragedy to argue against a beneficial action (vaccination) violates the JDA's definition of antisemitism by essentializing and stereotyping Jewish people."

Step-by-step explanation:
1. **Tweet Content Analysis**: The tweet discusses themes of divine forgiveness and acknowledges the existence of Israel without negative language.
2. **Antisemitic Criteria Check**:
   - No expressions of hatred or harm directed at Jews.
   - No references to anti-Semitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or denial of Jewish contributions.
3. **Conclusion**: The tweet is neutral and does not meet any criteria for antisemitism as defined.

The tweet is not antisemitic because it lacks any form of antisemitic expressions.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic based on the JDA definition. It acknowledges that God may not ""utterly destroy"" Jews and highlights that individuals in Judea are acceptable despite criticism of Israel as a whole.
