SS doctors during the selection send 77 men to be registered as prisoners. The remaining 749 people were murdered in gas chambers.,No,"The tweet provides a factual account of a historical event involving the deportation and murder of Jews during World War II. It does not contain any expressions of hatred, demonization, or blame directed specifically at Jews, nor does it use any language that aligns with antisemitic ideologies. The tweet accurately describes the victims without engaging in any narrative that would constitute antisemitism according to the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic as it presents factual information about a historical event involving the deportation and murder of Jews, without making any judgments or essentializations against them. It avoids using stereotypes, symbols, or coded language typical of antisemitism."

The organizations involved are known Palestinian groups and do not carry antisemitic connotations as they are not associated with any negative stereotypes or personal attacks on Jewish people. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.

The answer is based on the fact that the tweet does not explicitly or implicitly target any Jewish individuals, places, or institutions, and instead focuses on political support for an action against Palestinian prisoners without any language that would align with antisemitism.",No,"The tweet lists organizations that are not inherently antisemitic but instead support Palestinian rights and oppose specific actions like expulsion. These groups include AROCBayArea (advocating for Israel's rights), National SJP, Jews for Palestinian Right of Return, Palyouthmvmt, and Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, which is explicitly Palestinian. Their collective action against ""expulsion"" does not equate to antisemitism as defined by the JDA since they are part of a broader movement advocating for Palestinian rights and justice without targeting Jews specifically.

The tweet does not involve any antisemitic elements because it reflects the organizations' support for Palestinian narratives based on their identities or beliefs, rather than any negative characterization of Jews."

Its very sad.,Yes,"The tweet uses a stereotype by referring to Joel Petlin as a ""liberal Jew,"" which is an ethnic slur. This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, particularly the use of sinister stereotypes and negative character traits directed at a specific individual based on their Jewish heritage.

The tweet employs a stereotypical label that discriminates against Jews by associating them with a negative stereotype (liberal) in this context. Such labeling perpetuates antisemitic views without accurate representation or respect for Jewish individuals, fitting the IHRA criteria for antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet ""@Joelmpetlin Self hating liberal Jews. Its very sad."" does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Antisemitism** involves discrimination or targeting of a specific ethnic group, which this tweet does not do.
2. The tweet refers to Joelmpetlin as ""liberal Jews"" and describes them negatively without systemic prejudice or evidence-based conspiracy theories.
3. It targets an individual's perceived characteristics rather than the entire Jewish community.
4. There is no reference to Israel or problematic stereotypes tied to antisemitism, nor does it generalize beyond a single person.

Thus, the tweet is not antisemitic as it doesn't meet any of the JDA's criteria for discrimination or targeting a specific ethnic group."

It uses terms like ""racist"" to label Trump as a threat to Jews, directly accusing him of wanting to kill them. This explicitly aligns with the IHRA definition, which identifies antisemitism when individuals or statements express hatred toward Jews, particularly targeting specific groups. The tweet's use of the word ""Jews"" and its context of accusation towards a Jewish group make it clearly antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it includes terms that could be associated with anti-Semitic undertones, such as ""Nazi"" and references to ""Jews,"" these are used in a context that is not essentialized or generalized beyond historical precedents. The tweet does not explicitly deny or minimize the Holocaust or use language that would fit under JDA's guidelines for antisemitism, which include essentializing or treating an entire group with inherent biases without justification based on shared characteristics or traits.

The key points are:
1. **Relevance and Context**: The term ""Nazi"" could be problematic if used as a derogatory reference to Jews, but in this context, it is part of a broader critique that does not explicitly Essentialize Jews beyond historical associations.
2. **Non-Essentialization**: The tweet does not generalize or essentialize Jews based on their characteristics without providing evidence or context, which would be required for antisemitism under the JDA guidelines.

Therefore, while some elements might touch on anti-Semitic themes in a broader sense, they do not meet the specific criteria outlined by the JDA."

Hitler was a benevolent leader who did not try to exterminate Jews? They are trying to rewrite history?,Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it challenges factual historical truths regarding the Holocaust. By suggesting that 6 million people did not die in concentration camps and questioning Hitler's benevolence, the tweet perpetuates a false narrative aimed at discrediting Jewish history and victims. This behavior aligns with antisemitism, which involves the denial or distortion of historical atrocities committed against Jews, often to invalidate their narratives as victims.",No,"The tweet in question contains elements of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Specifically, it challenges and opposes the widely accepted historical facts about the Holocaust, including the numbers of victims, the existence of death camps, and the nature of Nazi actions. According to JDA guideline 10, denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist based on such historical claims constitutes antisemitism. The tweet's questioning of these facts undermines the recognition of a significant antisemitic event without addressing its truthfulness or implications, thereby aligning with the criteria for antisemitic behavior as outlined by the JDA."

This aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting specific groups (Jews) through rhetorical or discriminatory remarks about others. However, it is important to note that while the tweet may reflect historical contexts and stereotypes, it does not provide evidence-based claims about the individuals involved, thus contributing to potential antisemitic discrimination.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly engage in current forms of antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines. It refers to historical practices of hiding and transporting Jews, which are more about general statements rather than specific discrimination or prejudice against Jewish individuals today. Therefore, under the criteria provided, it is not classified as antisemitic.

The tweet's reference to past actions might be triggering for some due to historical context, but according to JDA guidelines, it does not engage in current discrimination practices."

The girl &amp; her family will be able to get good jobs with the PA now they've proved their willingness to kill Jews.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic based on the IHRA definition because it refers to ""Jews"" in a negative context, making broad generalizations that Jews are responsible for violence against non-Jews. It employs stereotypical language and labels a group by name without evidence, fitting the criteria of using negative stereotypes and inciting hatred towards Jews.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly use harmful symbols or make overtly discriminatory statements against Jews. However, it implies that the Palestinian Authority's actions toward Jews could indicate greater loyalty to Israel, touching on guideline 10 of the JDA regarding assumptions about Jewish loyalty based on external actions. This subtle critique might be seen as problematic under antisemitism definitions but doesn't meet the explicit criteria for full antisemitic speech without more context or coded language."

The content falsely associates the BBC with anti-Israel slurs and demonizes Jewish people, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes that target Jews or their communities. This constitutes antisemitism as defined by IHRA because it uses harmful stereotypes to characterize Jewish individuals and institutions.",No,"The tweet employs the hashtag #Antisemitism but refers to ""antisemites"" in a general and essentializing manner without providing specific evidence or context. This aligns with JDA's guideline 1, which prohibits treating people as inherent negatives through broad generalizations. The use of this term could be interpreted as essentializing groups, thus making the tweet antisemitic according to the definition provided."

Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet employs language that suggests discrimination against individuals it refers to as ""fake Jews,"" using negative assumptions about their group identity. It also implies that adhering to Orthodox Judaism is necessary, which could target Jews specifically if they don't comply with this criterion.

It employs dehumanizing language about the Holocaust and Jews, associating John Barden's stall presence with negative stereotypes without considering his actual motivations or contributions. This manipulation of perceptions towards a Jewish community to justify criticism aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

The tweet uses stereotypical claims about Jews controlling the world, which is a common tactic in antisemitism to denigrate entire groups rather than addressing valid concerns. Additionally, it dismisses human rights considerations for speculative reasons linked to a perceived Jewish conspiracy. This manipulation of facts and dehumanization towards a vulnerable group contribute to the classification of this tweet as antisemitic according to IHRA's standards.",Yes,The tweet supports or opposes Zionism by suggesting that non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries (point 10) and raises anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the world (point 2). These elements align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

However, the primary focus is on anti-Palestinian racism rather than explicitly targeting Jews. According to IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves directing hatred specifically toward Jews or their substitutes.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Essentialization**: The tweet doesn't make broad generalizations about American Jews.
2. **Link to Evil**: No mention of Jews linked to evil or harmful stereotypes.
3. **Expression (Words, Images, Deeds)**: No negative words or images related to Jews; it's neutral towards them.
4. **Coding**: There’s no hidden language referring to Jews negatively.

It refers to historical events involving Jewish participants but does not engage in any form of hatred, discrimination, or promotion of anti-Semitic ideologies. The context is about capturing and reded icating a temple, without any negative portrayal of Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It refers to a historical event involving the Temple in Jerusalem, presenting it neutrally and factually. There are no references to discrimination, prejudice, or any negative stereotypes against Jews. Instead, it depicts a narrative of compounding efforts leading to success, which aligns with factual accounts rather than antisemitic content.

The tweet does not fall under the examples provided in the JDA's guidelines for antisemitism, such as denial of Holocaust or promoting negative stereotypes about Jews.

By labeling the user's Holocaust-related tweets as mocks or displays of contempt, it specifically targets Jewish people, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. This behavior fits within the category of directing hatred toward Jews, particularly by referencing a historical event involving Jews (the Holocaust) and implying that such content is solely intended against them without any empathy.

The tweet's structure and content clearly indicate a shift from general criticism towards an antisemitic focus on Jewish individuals or communities. The use of ""@islamocommunism"" may suggest broader criticisms, but within this context, it is employed to mock or demean Jews, which constitutes antisemitism under IHRA's framework.

Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs antisemitic elements as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration. By associating the Holocaust with negative actions or mockery directed at Jews, the user is essentially using a stereotypical image tied to a historical event (the Holocaust) to generalize and mock an entire group based on their Jewishness. This aligns with guidelines B6 and A1 of the JDA, which prohibit applying negative stereotypes or essentializing groups based on shared characteristics such as ethnicity or history. The tweet's approach is therefore antisemitic because it treats Jews as a homogeneous group subject to reduction and generalization, using a historical event (the Holocaust) as a basis for contempt without considering individual experiences or contexts."

It attributes significant influence over global industries to ""German Jews,"" conflating their descent with control of major corporations like oil companies and banks. This stereotype implies a conspiratorial role attributed solely to Jews, aligning with antisemitic themes that Jews are collectively responsible for controlling critical institutions. The use of terms like ""Rithschikds"" and ""Rockefellers"" creatively references Jewish heritage but reinforces negative connotations by associating them with power and influence.

Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). First, let's break down what the JDA considers antisemitism. It defines it as discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews based on their Jewish identity.

Looking at the tweet: ""that called out the * directly in a veiled way, in which he clearly called them kikes... before he could make a comeback they killed him and blamed it on drugs."" 

The word ""kikes"" is used as slang for Black people. Even though it's veiled under the name, it still refers to a racial slur. The tweet directly targets Jewish individuals (Jews) by associating them with a derogatory term. Additionally, the context involves calling someone out, which can imply targeting a specific group.

According to JDA guidelines, antisemitism includes using symbols, images, or negative stereotypes directed at Jews. Here, ""kikes"" serves as such a stereotype. The tweet does not shy away from this slur but instead uses it in a derogatory context towards Jewish individuals.

Furthermore, the tweet's content involves calling out someone by name (though the name is starred), which can be seen as targeting a specific group based on their Jewish identity. This aligns with guideline 2 of JDA, where symbols and stereotypes are linked to evil or negative traits, including Jews.

Even though some might argue that it could be part of a larger conversation about justice, the explicit use of a racial slur like ""kikes"" points directly at Jews, making this tweet clearly antisemitic.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet uses the derogatory term ""kikes,"" which is a racial slur for Black people. This constitutes antisemitism as it discriminates against Jews by using a stereotype and labeling them negatively. Additionally, the context of calling someone out in this manner reflects the use of symbols or stereotypes targeted at Jewish individuals, consistent with JDA's definition."

These actions reflect a hostile perception of Jews by using slurs and aligning with anti-Semitic ideologies, thus qualifying as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet contains derogatory remarks targeting black and brown people using slurs like ""kikes"" and ""octaroons,"" which are deeply offensive and align with the principles of antisemitism as outlined in the JDA. These comments perpetuate harmful stereotypes, essentializing groups based on race without justification, thereby violating the guidelines against racial discrimination and essentialization."

Given the context suggesting antisemitic ideologies and the use of such language, it aligns with the IHRA's definition by targeting Jews in a negative manner.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs the racial slur ""kikes,"" which is often used to demean and stereotype Black individuals. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a people. The use of ""kikes"" constitutes a form of essentialization, treating an entire group based on a negative stereotype rather than individual characteristics. This type of racial slur aligns with antisemitic behavior as it perpetuates hostility and discrimination against Jews, targeting them based on their ethnicity without justification. Therefore, the tweet is classified as antisemitic under the JDA definition."

It refers to ""kikes,"" which is a slang term for Jews, but in this context, there is no indication that it is being used to target specific Jewish groups or individuals associated with Odessa and Ukraine. The tweet is neutral regarding antisemitism as defined by IHRA and does not fall into any of the categories listed in their examples of antisemitic behavior.

The IHRA definition focuses on specific forms of hatred, expression of hatred towards Jews, and certain types of actions and statements that target Jewish communities or state-level affairs. Since this tweet is about a diplomat being dismissed for using a term that might be considered anti-Semitic but without targeting specific Jewish groups or individuals, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.

Additionally, the tweet does not involve any illegal discrimination or denies opportunities to Jews, which are other aspects of antisemitism. It is merely a comment on the dismissal of an individual based on presumably unrelated reasons. Therefore, according to the IHRA working definition and examples provided, this tweet is not antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses the term ""kikes,"" which can carry connotations associated with antisemitism, particularly when directed at individuals from Odessa and Ukraine, regions with significant Jewish populations. The mention of these cities may imply a discriminatory intent towards Jews living there, aligning with guidelines that emphasize context and stereotypes related to antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic under the JDA definition.

The tweet may be interpreted as targeting Jews in a context where their presence could be problematic, potentially invoking negative stereotypes or essentializing their collective characteristics without justification. This aligns with JDA's guidelines that caution against using symbols, images, or stereotypes linked to antisemitism, especially in specific geopolitical contexts involving Jewish communities."

It primarily discusses general political rhetoric without targeting a specific group or using antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories. Therefore, it does not meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses slang (""kikes"") that can be associated with MAGA hat carriers, which are often pro-Polish nationalism. The term ""rawr"" in this context may carry a different connotation and is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet is more about humor and pro-Polish sentiment without targeting any specific Jewish group or using discriminative language against Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined in the JDA guidelines."
