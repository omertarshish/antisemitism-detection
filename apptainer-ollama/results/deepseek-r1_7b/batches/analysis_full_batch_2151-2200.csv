Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). First, I'll break down what the tweet says and see which parts of the guidelines might apply.

The tweet starts with ""Well Well\nDeviating from fact.\nLeftist  MSM Must scapegoat eh? \n1st Jews.. Now Christians\nWhen do we return 2 reality and civility?\n\n*In The Meantime Witness 👇\n\nThe ongoing disintegration of civilization brought to you by the Left\n\n#LeftistsAreNOTDemocratic \n#Walkaway https://t.co/jzyRHjXAkY""

Looking at this, I can see some key points. It starts by saying ""Deviating from fact."" and then mentions ""Leftist MSM Must scapegoat eh?"" followed by ""1st Jews.. Now Christians"". The rest of the tweet talks about returning to reality and civility but doesn't specify a date or context for when that will happen.

Next, there's a mention of ""The ongoing disintegration of civilization brought to you by the Left"" with hashtags ""#LeftistsAreNOTDemocratic"" and ""#Walkaway"".

Now, applying the JDA guidelines. The first thing I notice is the use of the word ""Jews"" towards the end in a negative context, referring to them as a reason for leftist actions. This aligns with point B6 of the JDA, which says that applying classical antisemitic symbols and stereotypes, such as targeting Jews, can be antisemitic.

Point B7 mentions treating Jews as agents of a country or requiring them to condemn certain policies publicly. The tweet doesn't do this directly but implies a negative stereotype towards Jews by suggesting they're behind the disintegration of civilization through the Left.

Additionally, the use of ""Leftist"" and ""Christians"" without context could be stereotyping different groups, which is another aspect of antisemitism as per guideline A1. The tweet doesn't specify what the Leftists are doing or why it's a problem for Jews specifically, but it's using broad terms that might carry harmful connotations.

There's also nothing in the tweet that supports points C1-C14, which deal with supporting human rights or not engaging in Boycotts, etc. Instead, it seems more focused on condemning groups without evidence and making broad generalizations.

So putting it all together, the tweet uses antisemitic language by associating Jews with negative stereotypes (B6), even if indirectly through broad accusations against leftism (B7). It also employs stereotyping (A1) which is a form of essentialization. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet would be considered antisemitic.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here's the detailed justification:

1. **Application of Classical Antisemitic Stereotypes**: The tweet uses the word ""Jews"" in a negative context, associating them with the Leftist actions and disintegration of civilization. This aligns with JDA B6, which states that applying classical antisemitic symbols and stereotypes to the State of Israel is antisemitic.

2. **Stereotyping**: The tweet employs broad generalizations by labeling groups without specific context or evidence, such as referring to ""Leftists"" and ""Christians."" This stereotyping, akin to essentializing a population (JDA A1), contributes to antisemitism.

3. **Essentialization**: By treating Jews as inherently tied to negative stereotypes without justification, the tweet violates JDA A2, which condemns the essentialization of populations based on traits like race or ethnicity.

4. **Condemnation Without Evidence**: The tweet attacks groups generally rather than addressing specific issues, leading to a lack of basis for such accusations and reinforcing harmful stereotypes (JDA B7).

In conclusion, the tweet's use of broad generalizations and stereotyping towards Jews, along with its negative associations without evidence, classifies it as antisemitic under the JDA guidelines."

**Summary:**
- **No**, the tweet is not antisemitic.
- It does not essentialize all Jews, invoke conspiracy theories about their collective identity, or engage in discrimination beyond targeting specific individuals."

The tweet employs language that could be seen as part of broader antisemitic tropes, associating an action with a national identity without considering individual contexts.

Additionally, it refers to the ""most evil man in the world"" as being killed without specifying that this person is Jewish, which might contribute to stereotyping or demonizing Jews collectively. These actions align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, as they involve targeting Jewish individuals and using problematic accusations about their conspiring to harm others.

The tweet's use of ""protection"" could suggest a lack of concern for actual harm done to Jews, which is a form of antisemitism by downplaying the severity of their suffering. It also aligns with the IHRA's criteria regarding the use of harmful stereotypes and conspiracy theories against Jewish people or Israel.",Yes,"The tweet raises concerns by focusing on the perceived ""protection"" given to Jews in 2020. This can be interpreted as implying a lack of fairness or justice, potentially leading to discrimination against Jews based on their race.

The tweet's critical remarks about ""protection"" could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes or biases, contributing to antisemitic ideologies by highlighting issues that may lead to unwarranted prejudice against Jews."

The tweet highlights two main points:
1. **Offering Free Food**: On April 23, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio offered free food to Muslims as part of an initiative promoting inclusivity. This is a neutral statement about community support and does not inherently involve antisemitism.
   
2. **Threatening Arrests Against Jews**: On April 28, the tweet mentions a threat to arrest Jews. This raises concerns under the IHRA's definition because it implies that Jews are being targeted for their identity without justification, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes or perceptions about Jewish people.

**Application of Antisemitism Criteria**:
- **Targeting Individuals by Identity**: The tweet specifically refers to ""Jews"" and mentions potential arrests as a result of this perception. This aligns with the IHRA's criterion of antisemitism involving hatred directed at Jews based on their identity.
  
- **Potential Discrimination**: Threatening arrest for perceived Jewish identity suggests a form of discrimination where Jews face unfair treatment, akin to how other groups might be subject to scrutiny.

In many jurisdictions, such targeted actions without a legitimate basis amount to antisemitic discrimination. Therefore, while the tweet does not explicitly use hateful language or stereotypes, its implication of unfair targeting aligns with the IHRA's framework, making it antisemitic according to their definition.",No,"The tweet discusses an incident involving De Blasio offering free food to Muslims and threatening to arrest Jews. It does not use any antisemitic language, symbols, or stereotypes typical of such behavior. Instead, it describes the actions neutrally without targeting Jews beyond their Jewish identity.

It references Folke Bernadotte, a figure known for saving 30,000 Jews during the Holocaust, and suggests that Israelis treated him harshly instead of respecting a peace plan. This implies a negative stereotype or conspiracy theory linking Israelis to harm or neglect towards Jewish individuals. The tweet employs language that could be interpreted as hatred toward Jews by associating them with historical actions or by implying that Israelis are responsible for Folke Bernadotte's treatment, thus perpetuating antisemitic ideologies.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic based on the JDA definition. While it references Folke Bernadotte and his role in saving Jews, which is problematic because he was a Nazi collaborator who contributed to the extermination of Jews. However, by framing him as someone who saved Jews from concentration camps but still being killed by Israelis for this act might be more about political or historical context rather than directly targeting Jews as a group.

Specifically, it calls for Muslims to engage in jihad against Jews, uses terminology like ""jihadi"" which can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and potentially incite hatred towards Jews, and is directed at a specific ethnic group (Jews) while being hosted by an organization promoting anti-racism. These actions fit within the IHRA's framework of antisemitic behavior, particularly through hate speech and stereotyping.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitic tendencies by associating Islamic extremists with targeting Jews through jihad, thereby reinforcing stereotypes and generalizations about Muslims.

The tweet's association of Islamic extremism with antisemitism contributes to harmful stereotypes. Additionally, it promotes the idea that targeting specific groups (Jews) is acceptable or justifiable, which contradicts the JDA's warning against essentialization and discrimination. The use of terms like ""jihad"" may imply extremist actions directed at Jews, further reinforcing negative stereotypes about Muslims.

In summary, the tweet is antisemitic as it involves stereotyping, essentializing a population, and promoting harmful associations that go against the principles outlined in the JDA guidelines."

2. **Question about actions towards Jews and Palestinians**: The question suggests a bias against Jews in terms of their contributions or well-being, perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes.

This aligns with the JDA's guidelines, particularly regarding the idea that Jews are linked to evil (point 2) and applying such symbols or images to a state like Israel (point 7). The use of historical hatred as a justification for criticism aligns with projecting historical contexts onto modern issues, thus making the tweet antisemitic."

Many muslims are always hating Jews. Because Mohammed did so.,Yes,"The tweet exhibits elements consistent with antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It perpetuates harmful stereotypes by generalizing about Jewish people's living conditions (e.g., ""only one state where Jews can live in peace"") and associates Jews with negative stereotypes tied to religious figures like Mohammed, thereby blaming Jews collectively for perceived汇集 of harm or discrimination against them.",Yes,"The tweet uses several JDA guidelines to promote antisemitism. It aligns with guideline 7 by suggesting that Jews are agents of Israel's actions, as it implies they need a separate state for peace and associates them with negative stereotypes like hating Muslims because of Mohammed. Additionally, it references guideline 9 by implying loyalty to an external power over national unity among Jews themselves. These practices fit the definition of antisemitism outlined in the JDA."

I'm not anti-Semite, I'm anti-termite!"" https://t.co/bxzg5oNj3b",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA definition because it does not involve denying the Holocaust or using conspiracy theories about Jews. While it references ""Jews"" as enemies, which could be stereotypical, the tweet's primary content is a personal attack on Hitler, with the mention of Jews as an afterthought without deeper ideological context related to antisemitism.",No,"Farrakhan's tweet does not qualify as antisemitic according to the JDA. While he labels Jews as his enemies, this use is more of a personal attack rather than systemic discrimination or essentializing a group based on their identity. The term ""termite"" in his second statement adds confusion without reinforcing any negative stereotype about Jews.

The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA because it lacks the systematic hostility, generalization, or stereotyping typical of such behavior. Instead, it appears to be a personal choice that may stem from elsewhere rather than being based on antisemitic premises."
