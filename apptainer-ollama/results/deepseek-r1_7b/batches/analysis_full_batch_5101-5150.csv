Okay, I need to determine if the provided tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully:

""Just another @UKLabour supporter/member pretending to be Jewish whilst calling us ""ZioNazis"" (white supremacist talk for Jews) &amp; announcing Jews are ""pedophiles.""\n\nHard left = Far-right, two cheeks of the same arse.\n\n#LabourAntisemitism https://t.co/xffSdJ9B3d""

The tweet seems to be a complaint against members of UK Labour who it claims are pretending to be Jewish and has made offensive statements. The key points here are:

1. The tweet uses the term ""ZioNazis,"" which is an acronym for Zionists and Nazis, often used as a derogatory term for Jews.
2. It also claims that the target group (Jews) are pedophiles.

Now, looking at the IHRA definition provided: Antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews expressed through various means, including speech, writing, actions, etc., using negative stereotypes or blaming Jews collectively for societal issues.

The tweet is clearly making derogatory remarks about Jews. The use of ""ZioNazis"" is a known antisemitic term that implies EITHER EITHER Zionists supporting Nazis (a historical context) OR simply an acronym meant to be offensive against both groups, which in this case targets Jews. Additionally, the statement about Jews being pedophiles is a direct discriminatory claim against the Jewish community.

The tweet also equates members of the Labour party with white supremacists and describes them negatively as having two cheeks of the same arse, which further dehumanizes and stigmatizes a group based on their party affiliation but ties it to negative stereotypes about Jews.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism can manifest in speech, such as calling out someone by name with hateful terms. Here, while the tweet doesn't directly name individuals, it's referring to ""UK Labour supporter-members"" pretending to be Jewish and making these derogatory remarks. This qualifies as antisemitic speech directed at Jews.

Furthermore, the tweet uses a mix of language that is both historical (ZioNazis) and modern-day derogatory terms (pedophiles), which aligns with the IHRA's description of using negative character traits or stereotypes to target Jews.

Criminality in antisemitism would depend on context, but since this seems more like a public criticism rather than an act against individuals or property, it falls under discrimination and public criticism, both of which are covered by the IHRA definition.

Therefore, considering all these points, the tweet meets multiple criteria outlined for antisemitic behavior according to the IHRA.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic as per the IHRA definition because it employs derogatory language such as ""ZioNazis"" and ""pedophiles,"" which are designed to denigrate Jews. The use of these terms falls under speech, writing, or visual forms that express hatred towards Jews. Additionally, the tweet contains statements that target Jews collectively, aligning with antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses coded language such as ""ZioNazis"" which is a derogatory term associated with Jews, and falsely labels them as ""pedophiles,"" creating harmful stereotypes.

These actions violate the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism, particularly regarding discrimination, stereotyping, and essentialization."

By doing so, it aligns with the JDA guidelines where using negative stereotypes about Jewish identity can constitute antisemitism. Additionally, the use of terms like ""Jew"" in a self-identifier (""GnasherJew"") and associating oneself with anti-Zionist labels may imply that Jews are responsible for certain actions or should be held accountable, thereby contributing to antisemitic behavior."

Instead, it employs derogatory language such as ""ZioNazis"" and refers to Jews in harmful terms like pedophiles, which could be seen as perpetuating stereotypes rather than direct antisemitic acts. However, using coded language that associates Jews with negative traits without clear evidence aligns with the JDA's guidelines on coded speech and Holocaust denial, making it a nuanced case where it doesn't meet the full criteria but may still reflect antisemitism in its context or intent."

**Final Answer:**  
DECISION: Yes",Yes,"The tweet employs derogatory slurs such as ""zions,"" ""zionazis,"" and ""gnasher scum"" that are commonly used to denigrate Jews. These terms fall under the definition of antisemitism as they constitute discrimination, prejudice, or a broader negative stereotype targeting the Jewish community without context or proportionality.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition Check**: The tweet uses terms like ""zions,"" which are known anti-Semitic slurs meant to demean Jews.
2. **Guideline 2**: By substituting these terms for Jews, it employs symbols and stereotypes that fit the antisemitic pattern described in guideline 2.
3. **Use of Derogatory Language**: The inclusion of ""gnasher scum"" is another example of a coded term that stigmatizes Jews without basis or context.
4. **Pattern of Discrimination**: The tweet continues previous patterns seen on Twitter, reinforcing negative stereotypes and antisemitic views.

In conclusion, the tweet consistently uses antisemitic language as per the JDA's definition by employing discriminatory terms to target the Jewish community."

Additionally, it does not reference any negative stereotypes of Jews, make claims about Jews being linked to evil, or express any form of discriminatory intent towards the Jewish community.

Furthermore, while the tweet could potentially be seen as part of broader media coverage of political events, the question of whether non-biased media would report this specific incident is outside the scope of determining antisemitism.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Tweet Content:** The tweet is about a political event involving President Obama, an Israeli plan to kill Soleimani, and a leak of details to Iran. It includes a biblical perspective but no direct mention or context related to Jews or Israel beyond the external actors.

2. **Check for Antisemitic Elements:** Antisemitism involves targeting or expressing hatred toward Jews as people or groups. The tweet does not reference any aspects of antisemitism, such as negative stereotypes about Israelis, denial of historical facts involving the Holocaust, or use of antisemitic symbols (e.g., Jesus, blood libel).

3. **Assess Context and Language:** The language used is neutral and factual, discussing political actions without any overtly antisemitic statements or biases.

4. **Conclusion:** Since there are no elements aligning with IHRA's definition, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question is reporting on an event involving American and Iranian figures regarding a political action against Iran by Israel.

This association aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly when such associations are perceived to imply anti-Semitic bias or conspiracy theories targeting Jews.

The tweet draws a connection between Israel and the US's actions against Iran, potentially implying that Jews are involved in these aggressions. Given that Israel is a Jewish state, this association could be seen as perpetuating antisemitic narratives about the perception of Jews' role in global politics. Thus, it meets the criteria for being considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition.

Additionally, using symbols or metaphors associated with antisemitism, such as implying conspiracy theories about Jews, contributes to the classification of this tweet as antisemitic. Therefore, based on the analysis, the tweet is deemed antisemitic according to the IHRA's working definition.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews or use any language that would align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

While the tweet doesn't directly reference Jews or use antisemitic stereotypes explicitly, its context and language could be misinterpreted as part of a broader narrative that might align with antisemitism.

Key points:

1. **Stereotyping and Generalization**: The comparison between toilet paper production sources could rely on stereotypes associated with China's manufacturing capabilities, potentially leading to a generalizable judgment about other countries' industries without factual basis.

2. **Judgmental and Critical Language**: The use of harsh language (""This is so stupid..."") could be interpreted as part of antisemitic speech if intended to generalize or stereotype a group without factual support.

3. **Broader Context**: While the tweet doesn't directly mention Jews, its critical nature towards a specific country (Israel) could be part of a narrative that might be conflated with antisemitic rhetoric if it's used in conjunction with other such slurs.

However, without explicit references to Jews or using stereotypical language about them, this tweet does not fully meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. It leans toward broader criticism but doesn't specifically target Jews as a group or use harmful stereotypes explicitly related to them.",No,"The tweet in question does not contain any references to Jews, anti-Semitic stereotypes, or criticism of Israeli policies that would align with the JDA definition of antisemitism.

It is merely a call for solidarity against an external campaign affecting Israel, without targeting Jews specifically or using any antisemitic stereotypes or language.

According to the JDA guidelines, while criticizing Zionism as a form of nationalism is acceptable when done without assigning responsibility to Jews, the tweet does not assign any negative stereotypes or link Jews with harmful actions. It supports equality between Israel and Palestine and avoids antisemitic elements by not promoting any negative caricatures or coded language against Jews.

The tweet's message focuses on opposing an external campaign as a means to protect Israel, rather than making any claims that would be considered antisemitic under the JDA definition. There is no indication of discrimination, prejudice, or hostility directed at Jews in this context."

However, since Israel did not implement apartheid (a policy associated with South Africa), the tweet inaccurately associates a negative policy with a Jewish country. This could be seen as perpetuating antisemitism by targeting Jews through misleading or pejorative language, potentially reflecting harmful stereotypes about Jews and their relationship with policies attributed to their country.",Yes,"The tweet ""Europe kowtows to Israeli apartheid"" uses the term ""kotov,"" which is a derogatory slur specifically targeting Jews, and refers to Palestinian suffering through the metaphor of apartheid. This aligns with JDA's guidelines on antisemitism, as it employs negative stereotypes and slurs directed at Jewish people, thereby perpetuating antisemitic views."
