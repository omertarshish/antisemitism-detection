It is a general advice about holy days and does not target Jews or convey any discriminatory remarks against them. There is no indication of promoting hatred, blaming Jews collectively, or using negative stereotypes related to Jewish people.",No,"The tweet in question advises against discussing the fate of Jews during a holy day. This could imply exclusion or stigmatization of Jews, aligning with the definition of antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice against Jewish people. By making such a statement without context, it potentially reinforces negative stereotypes and exclusionary practices, thus being considered antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines."

While it touches on voting patterns among Jewish individuals, it does not meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as defined because it lacks explicit hatred, negative character traits, or systematic conspiracies against Jews.

The tweet focuses on the disparity in political parties represented by Jewish individuals but does not perpetuate any harmful stereotypes or negative perceptions about the entire Jewish community. It appears to be a critique of party dynamics rather than an expression of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet addresses the representation of Jews in Congress and poses rhetorical questions about their voting patterns. It does not employ any discriminative language, stereotypes, or generalizations typical of antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines. Instead, it presents factual observations without targeting or discriminating against Jews based on their Jewish identity."

It does not explicitly target or express hatred toward Jewish individuals or groups, nor does it use language that aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which involves directed hatred towards Jews through specific expressions like symbols, stereotypes, or accusations of wrongdoing.

The tweet's focus is on fair treatment and contribution to saving a divine figure (Jesus), using metaphors rather than overtly antisemitic statements. It does not deny or Responsibility for the Holocaust or suggest antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish people or Israel. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria set by the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet employs a stereotype by singling out servants and treating them unfairly without regard for their religion. This aligns with antisemitism as it discriminates against non-Jews (specifically servants) rather than addressing their Jewish identity, thus violating JDA's definition of discrimination."

While this may touch on stereotyping, the IHRA definition specifically includes expressions directed at Jewish individuals or institutions. Here, the tweet is not targeting any specific individual or institution but rather a general category of Jewish communities. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA because it lacks specificity and direction towards particular individuals or institutions.",No,"The tweet in question critiques a political approach taken by a Mayor of New York City regarding addressing Jewish communities. It does not make specific generalizations, coded language, or direct discriminatory remarks against Jews. Instead, it seems to be a critique of the method used rather than targeting individuals within the Jewish community. Therefore, based on the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not considered antisemitic as it does not engage in discrimination or stigmatization directed at Jews themselves but instead addresses the approach taken by another individual."

It is a request for information, specifically asking for evidence of statements about Israel and apologies from those making such claims.

The tweet's purpose is to encourage others to provide information rather than to attack or denounce Jewish individuals or groups.",No,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Targeting Jews Specifically**: The tweet includes a direct reference to ""Jews in general,"" which inherently targets the Jewish community by name, violating guideline 7 of the JDA.

2. **Collective Responsibility and Essentialization**: By asking for quotes or apologies regarding an argument about Israel without addressing the specifics, it encourages stereotyping and essentializing Jews as a homogeneous group, which is problematic under guideline 9.

3. **General Language and Negative Stereotypes**: The mention of ""Jews in general"" implies a stereotype that could be used to generalize and marginalize the Jewish community, aligning with guidelines 1 and 3 regarding essentialization and discrimination.

Thus, the tweet contains elements that make it antisemitic by targeting Jews specifically, using language that may imply stereotypes, and encouraging collective responsibility without addressing individual cases."

This stereotyping targets Jews through their association with Israel, aligning with antisemitic definitions that involve discriminatory perceptions or associations towards Jewish groups. Thus, it meets the criteria for being antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with antisemitic themes. By suggesting that ""Americans"" refers to Jews from Israel and then arguing that the term 'America' should be understood as an Israeli-American regime, the tweet associates a stereotypical negative image (Jews) with the label 'American.' This falls under examples 6 and 7 of the JDA, which involve applying stereotypes or collectively holding responsible for actions tied to the state of Israel. While political speech is generally protected under human rights laws, this specific use of redefinition and stereotype application crosses into antisemitism by reifying a negative trait associated with a group."

It includes a list of personal opinions about a category broadly referred to as ""Jews"" without providing specific Jewish content, such as cultural references or detailed descriptions that would align with antisemitic expressions. Additionally, it addresses anti-Semitism within a political context rather than explicitly targeting Jewish individuals or communities in violation of the IHRA's definition. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic under IHRA guidelines.",Yes,"Andrew Neil's tweet criticizes a person for writing about ""hating Motherf*cking Jews"" and lambasts the Labour Party for not addressing anti-Semitism. This involves equating the Labour Party with anti-Semitic actions against Jews, which aligns with JDA guidelines that define antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice against Jews. The tweet uses language implying the Labour Party is part of an anti-Semitic conspiracy targeting Jews, thus it is antisemitic according to the JDA."

Now you know.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits elements of antisemitism as per the IHRA definition. It uses negative language to characterize zionists in a derogatory manner, equates their threat with historical atrocities against Jews (the Holocaust), and employs broad generalizations about Jewish people (using ""zionists like you""). These actions align with antisemitic stereotypes and propaganda, fitting within the criteria of blaming or attacking Jewish communities collectively.",Yes,"1. **Linking Jews to Antisemitism through Zionism**: The tweet refers to ""Zionists like you"" as the threat, which ties Jews to evil via Zionism (guideline 2). This parallels historical anti-Semitic narratives linking Jews with forces of evil.
   
2. **Stereotypes and Generalization**: The use of terms like ""Batshit crazy"" and associating Jews with negative stereotypes (Zionists) exemplifies the generalization common in antisemitism (guideline 1).

3. **Denying Holocausus**: By referencing the Holocaust, it employs a known tactic to deny factual evil done by Jews (point 10), a core antisemitic act.

4. **Equivocation on Antisemitism**: The tweet suggests that all anti-Semitism stems from a group (Zionists) rather than individual actions or context, blurring lines between collective and individual blame (guideline 3).

5. **Use of Exaggeration and Denial**: The mention of ""6 million"" is an Holocaust denial tactic, directly challenging the reality of the atrocities committed by Jews.

Thus, the tweet employs multiple facets of antisemitism as defined, including equating Jews with evil forces, generalizing about their motives, denying historical atrocities, and using denigratory language."

It does not contain any discriminatory language or apply negative stereotypes to Jews, nor does it make sweeping generalizations or link Jews to harmful actions without context. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not antisemitic.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism under JDA:** Antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews, based on their Jewishness.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet's Content:**
   - The tweet reports factual information about deportations and the Holocaust.
   - It does not reference any stereotypes, biases, or negative connotations towards Jews.

3. **Applying JDA Guidelines:**

   - **Guideline A.2:** There is no link to forces of evil or negative stereotypes towards Jews, as the tweet is neutral and factual.
   - **Other Guidelines (B-C):** The tweet doesn't reference Israel/Palestine or apply any biases against them.

4. **Conclusion:** Since the tweet is factual and neutral without any antisemitic elements, it does not qualify as antisemitic under JDA."

It employs stereotypical language that labels Jews negatively based on their religion, equating them with an extremist group (""extremists and part of a brainwashed cult""). This characterization simplifies Jews as a group without considering individual diversity, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism which includes making negative character traits or grouping people based on perceived commonalities. The tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes that could contribute to hatred or discrimination against Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA. It discriminates against Jews by associating their religious practice with extremism and a brainwashed cult, using religious affiliation as a basis for negative judgment.

Additionally, the mention of ""illegal settlements"" and labeling specific groups as part of an ""apartheid regime"" reinforces antisemitic stereotypes by targeting Jews collectively while ignoring other contributing factors or perspectives on Israeli-Palestinian relations.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their Jewishness. The tweet in question uses the term ""apartheid,"" which is often associated with a historical system of racial segregation, and applies it metaphorically to self-appointed leaders supporting illegal settlements. While this doesn't directly equate to systemic apartheid but could be seen as projecting a negative stereotype onto a group. However, under JDA guidelines, the use of symbols like ""apartheid"" that carry connotations tied to Jewish people can lead to antisemitism by implying categorization or stigmatization without evidence. Thus, while some might argue it's more about land issues, the mention of ""apartheid"" leans toward being antisemitic due to potential stereotyping."

While it uses broad accusations against a Jewish community, it is framed in a context unrelated to antisemitism as defined by IHRA (which often involves conspiracy theories about Jews). The tweet's focus on the mayor and its positive tone suggest it is more of a critique of local governance rather than an antisemitic statement.",No,"The tweet in question does touch on themes that could be considered antisemitic as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). By focusing on Hasidic Jews and implying they broke the law during a pandemic, it targets a specific Jewish subgroup. However, the JDA's guidelines suggest that while such statements may involve antisemitic rhetoric, particularly regarding specific actions or groups, they don't fully align with the broader criteria of the definition provided. The tweet doesn't reference historical conspiracies or use harmful stereotypes about Jews in general but rather criticizes a specific group without inherent context.

The user expresses their voting intention based on concern for the safety of ""Jews,"" which is framed positively without any overt hatred or stereotyping. Antisemitism typically involves negative perceptions or actions targeting Jews, and this statement focuses on a positive intent related to protecting Jews rather than expressing any antisemitic bias.

However, it's important to note that context matters. If such statements are part of a broader conversation where anti-Semitic criticisms of Israel are normalized, they might be interpreted as such. But in isolation, the tweet itself does not meet the criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not qualify as antisemitic under the JDA guidelines.

This use of negative stereotypes about Jews linked to a media outlet aligns with JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly under guideline B.1, which prohibits applying such symbols or images to Israel in an antisemitic manner."

It employs stereotypes to generalize these ideologies to a specific ethnic group, contributing to a negative perception that could marginalize Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet essentializes Jews by suggesting that both communism and Naziism were created solely by Jews. This creates a harmful stereotype where an entire group is linked to the creation of oppressive ideologies, thereby exhibiting antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines.

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Essentialization:** The tweet treats Jews as the sole or primary cause behind the creation of communism and Naziism. Essentializing a group into being solely responsible for historical events is a form of discrimination.

2. **Stereotyping:** By implying that Jews created these ideologies, it reinforces negative stereotypes about Jewish peoplehood. Such statements can foster prejudice and hostility towards Jews.

3. **Linking to Evil:** The tweet ties Jews directly to the creation of oppressive ideologies like communism (which has had both positive and negative impacts) and Naziism (a known cause of significant human suffering). This aligns with antisemitic notions that Jews are linked to forces of evil.

4. **Reinforcement of Biased View:** Essentializing a group into being solely responsible for historical developments can contribute to a biased and discriminatory view, which is a key aspect of antisemitism as per the JDA guidelines.

Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition because it involves essentializing Jews into a sole cause behind significant historical events."

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition Analysis:** The tweet mentions hatred toward Jews explicitly.
2. **Targeting Based on Identity:** It uses antisemitic language by singling out Jews and others for hate.
3. **Context of Hate Speech:** The message is part of a broader hate speech context, which often includes stereotyping or generalizations about Jews.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Context:** The tweet refers to Trump's handling of Democrats but does not specifically target any Jewish individuals or groups.
   
2. **Language and Claims:** The user misrepresents Israel, suggesting it is a liar, which could imply a broader critique towards Trump's policies on Jews but doesn't directly name any Jewish people.

3. **Targeted Individuals:** Antisemitism requires targeting specific individuals or groups perceived as Jewish. Here, no such targeting occurs.

4. **Lack of Specific Reference:** The tweet does not explicitly refer to any particular Jewish person or group being antisemitic; it refers more generally to Trump's actions against Democrats.

5. **Conclusion:** Without specific targeting of Jews or their institutions, the tweet doesn't meet IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).
