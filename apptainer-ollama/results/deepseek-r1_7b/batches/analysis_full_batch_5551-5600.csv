According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes both expressions (like speech or writing) and actions directed toward Jewish individuals or their property. This tweet falls under the category of antisemitic behavior as it involves harm towards a specific group based on their identity.",Yes,"The tweet in question, ""Things that will not Free Palestine: vandalizing Jewish houses of worship in America,"" is antisemitic according to the JDA definition. Vandalizing Jewish houses of worship constitutes discrimination and targets Jews specifically by their identity as Jews. This action aligns with point 3 of section B, which states that antisemitism can be manifested in deeds such as violence or attacks directed at someone because they are Jewish. Additionally, essentializing Jews based on their faith is a form of racism (point 1), and the act described here is not factually accurate but still violates the definition by targeting Jews as a group without justification. Thus, this tweet exhibits antisemitic behavior."
1151675006113460225,xkillerbunnyx,2019-07-18 02:08:13+00:00,0,Jews,Jews are literally physically blockading ICE facilities because we know they�re concentration camps  so maybe stop� https://t.co/tPJfeAnT9C,No,"The tweet is not inherently antisemitic. It references ICE facilities metaphorically without targeting specific individuals or groups, avoiding the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving direct targeting of Jewish people or their properties.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentialization and Generalization**: The tweet broadly generalizes that all Jews are responsible for blocking ICE facilities, which risks essentializing Jews as a homogeneous group without considering individual contexts.

2. **Linking Jews to Evil Stereotypes**: By associating Jews with concentration camps, the tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes that reduce Jews to villains, potentially aiding antisemitic narratives of persecution or repression.

3. **Antisemitic Language and Generalization**: The statement employs language that treats Jews as a collective group acting against ICE facilities due to their association with negative connotations (concentration camps), which can be used to stigmatize or justify harmful actions towards Jewish communities.

4. **Suggestion of Stigma**: The tweet suggests an action (blocking ICE) linked to concentration camps, potentially contributing to antisemitic propaganda by reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews.

5. **Potential Historical Denial**: By associating Jews with concentration camps, the tweet may invalidate or deny their humanity through stigmatization rather than addressing the specific actions in question.

Overall, the tweet employs multiple facets of antisemitism as defined by the JDA, including essentialization, stereotyping, and association with negative stereotypes."

While the IHRA definition allows for broad statements about Jews as a group, antisemitism typically involves directed discrimination toward specific individuals or institutions linked to Jews. In this context, Oz's comment could reflect broader perceptions of discrimination within EHRC or JLM, especially if it pertains to specific Jewish individuals in those organizations. Therefore, the tweet aligns with antisemitic principles by expressing negative perceptions towards Jews as a group, even without explicit targeting of individuals.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Jews being subjected to humiliation and exclusionary behavior in the context of a EHRC decision. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination or treatment directed at Jews based on their ethnicity. Specifically, it touches upon point B6, where symbols, images, or negative stereotypes are applied to Israel, which is a form of antisemitic behavior. The tweet does not indicate a non-antisemitic context and directly impacts Jewish individuals rather than broader categories without specific targeting."

This aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves directing hatred and discrimination toward Jews, often through broad and negative categorizations. The tweet oversimplifies the victims and the criminal act into a stereotype, contributing to antisemitic rhetoric that harms the Jewish community without factual basis or respect for individuals.",No,"The tweet discusses the arrest of white supremacists responsible for harming 11 Jews and references a mention that is unclear (likely an error). It focuses on addressing the specific acts against Jews without engaging in anti-Semitic language or generalizations about the Jewish community. The tweet's content does not consistently apply anti-Semitic stereotypes or exhibit bias beyond reporting on the event, making it non-antisemitic based on the JDA criteria."

It�s especially galling because so much of CPAC was� https://t.co/yb4heBtNjt,Yes,"The tweet explicitly advocates for ""gassing Jews,"" which is synonymous with promoting genocide against the Jewish people. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes actions that perpetrate hatred or violence toward Jews. The promotion of such an act directly targets Jews and aligns with the definition provided by IHRA. The use of strong and harmful language regarding the Holocaust and genocide further supports this classification as an antisemitic act.",Yes,"The tweet directly references a publication, The Daily Stormer, which advocates for gassing Jews, explicitly promoting violence against Jews. This aligns with guideline 9 of the JDA, which addresses discrimination and negative portrayal of Jews without justification. Additionally, the use of terms like ""gassing"" adds to the antisemitic nature by suggesting violent actions against Jewish people. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition.

The tweet contains a clear reference to violence and discrimination against Jews, making it an example of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA)."

While it touches on a sensitive topic, it does not explicitly use harmful stereotypes, negative perceptions of Jews, or directly attack the Jewish community. It appears to be an analytical statement about cultural processes without overtly promoting or attacking Jewish communities. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic as it does not involve deploying negative stereotypes or expressing hatred toward Jewish individuals or groups.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic. It refers to anti-Semitism as a factor in the survival of Jews through assimilation, which is a historical and social phenomenon rather than direct discrimination or stigmatization against Jews. The tweet uses the concept of anti-Semitism without essentializing or applying harmful stereotypes directed specifically at the Jewish community.

The analysis considers whether the tweet falls under any category of antisemitism defined by the JDA. Since it does not use coded language, imagery, or make sweeping generalizations about Jews, and instead discusses a broader social impact of anti-Semitic ideologies, it is not classified as antisemitic."

Like I mean holy shit, this� https://t.co/VZ4VXyCxBF",Yes,"The tweet in question employs broad, generalized language directed at the Jewish community without targeting specific individuals or instances. The rhetorical questioning and use of exclamation marks suggest a stereotypical stereotype about Jews, which aligns with the IHRA definition that includes mendacious, demonizing, or dehumanizing allegations against Jews as a group. While there is no direct reference to Israel, the tweet's nature suggests a generalization that could be interpreted as harmful towards Jewish individuals or communities, thus fitting within the scope of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet expresses frustration about people tearing down Jews but lacks specific examples or context of such behavior. The use of words like ""hell"" and ""tear down"" without providing factual instances can perpetuate negative stereotypes, aligning with antisemitism as defined by essentializing a group without justification. Additionally, the tone may imply broad negative judgments towards Jews, which is problematic under the guidelines of the JDA. Thus, it is considered antisemitic because it risks essentializing an entire group based on general statements about them."

It references ""The King of the Jews,"" which typically refers to Jesus Christ and carries no negative connotation toward Jews. There is no indication of hatred, conspiracy theories, or discrimination targeting Jews. The tweet remains neutral and unrelated to antisemitism.",No,"The tweet ""RT @TeaPainUSA: More bad news for the King of the Jews."" does not appear to be antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Reference Analysis**: The tweet refers to someone as ""the King of the Jews,"" which is a derogatory title without any overtly antisemitic imagery or context that would link it specifically to negative stereotypes about Jewish people or their leaders.

2. **Guideline 6 and 9 Consideration**: While guidelines related to Israel-Palestine might suggest potential issues with negative references, the tweet does not explicitly apply such stereotypes to Israel as a whole but rather uses ""Jews"" in a generic sense without context.

3. **Human Rights Protections (Guideline 15)**: The tweet's content falls under permissible criticism of political figures within the scope of human rights protections, which do not inherently target specific groups unless the context justifies such categorization.

4. **Lack of Context**: Without additional context indicating loyalty issues or marginalization, the title ""King of the Jews"" does not carry enough antisemitic connotation to be classified as such under JDA guidelines.

Thus, the tweet is not considered antisemitic based on the provided criteria."

It is a general critique of Rudy Giuliani's leadership and does not target Jewish individuals, groups, or institutions with any form of hatred, discrimination, or negative stereotypes. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA guidelines.",No,"The tweet employs antisemitic elements by associating Jews with negative stereotypes and using them to Essentialize the tweet-taker's character. It involves a stereotype linking Jews to someone else's actions (Rudy Giuliani) and personal attacks without context, contributing to antisemitism as per JDA guidelines.

The tweet uses the term ""Jews"" in a way that could be viewed as essentializing, aligning with guideline 1. It also incorporates anti-Semitic fantasizing about Jews being victims of external forces, as seen in guideline 2. The personal attack on the tweet-taker without evidence adds another layer of antisemitism by Essentializing an individual's character. Overall, while the tweet doesn't directly reference Israel or Palestinian issues, it still touches upon elements that violate JDA definitions."

It employs stereotyping and negative character traits to label Jews as perpetrators against other groups, without providing context or acknowledging the diversity within any community.

---

**Analysis:**

1. **Definition of Antisemitism:** According to IHRA, antisemitism involves hatred toward Jews directed at individuals or institutions.
2. **Tweet Content:** The tweet labels Muslims killed by ""Jews"" in Palestine as a generalizable stereotype about Jews committing violence against Muslims elsewhere.
3. **Stereotyping and Negative Stereotypes:** Using ""Jews"" to imply they are responsible for killing Muslims without context is a negative stereotype.
4. **Rhetorical Charge:** It implies Jews are guilty of these killings, potentially contributing to antisemitism.

The tweet uses harmful stereotypes about Jews to target Muslims in a way that could be seen as antisemitic by IHRA standards.",No,"The tweet employs antisemitic language by essentializing Jews through negative stereotypes associated with acts of violence. It lists groups such as Muslims being victims of ISIS, thereby tying Jews to the perpetrators. This aligns with JDA guidelines 6 and 7, which prohibit applying antisemitic symbols or holding Jews responsible for external actions, thus it is not antisemitic according to the given definition."

It promotes a negative perception of Jews without providing specific context or refutation, thus fitting the IHRA definition as it reflects harmful stereotypes and critique of Jewish people.",No,"The tweet does not contain any explicit discriminatory language or references. It is about Alan Dershowitz, a Jewish-American lawyer, and his statements are discussed without any antisemitic content. There's no indication of treating him negatively based on his Jewish identity beyond the neutral context provided.

It conflates stereotypical behavior with voting patterns without addressing particular instances of antisemitism.

The tweet is a broad generalization that may imply a stereotype but does not directly accuse specific individuals, groups, or properties of hatred or discrimination based on Jewish identity. Thus, it does not constitute antisemitic behavior under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet in question does not inherently present as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it implies that Democrats treat Jews poorly, this statement is made without specific targeting of individual Jewish people or using any negative stereotypes about them.

While the tweet mentions targeting individuals guarding a place of significance to Jews (a holy site), it does not explicitly exhibit any form of antisemitic behavior as defined by the IHRA. Antisemitism, according to the IHRA, involves hatred toward Jews expressed in speech, writing, visual forms, and action using negative stereotypes or blame on Jews collectively or individually. The tweet does not include any such elements; it is a neutral description of an incident targeting people guarding a place where Jews are present, without any overtly antisemitic content or symbols.

The IHRA definition emphasizes the expression of hatred toward Jews in various forms—speech, writing, visual, and action—but this tweet lacks these expressions. It does not mention the Holocaust, use antigeminate symbols (like claims that Jews killed Jesus), or accuse Jews of conspiracy or control over institutions. Instead, it is an incident description without overtly antisemitic content.

Thus, while the tweet indirectly targets Jews by preventing them from visiting a holy site, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA definition because it lacks the necessary elements such as hate speech,use of negative stereotypes, or explicit blame on Jews.",No,"The tweet does not contain elements that align with the JDA definition of antisemitism. It describes an incident where rioters attacked policemen guarding a holy site while trying to stop Jews from touring.

This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes where Jews are portrayed as responsible for their own misfortunes or those of others, even when it's based on religious texts rather than factual evidence. The use of derogatory language such as ""dammed Jews"" further perpetuates negative stereotypes and prejudice against Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet attributes blame for ""their doing"" and lack of forgiveness solely to Jews as referenced in the Quran. This essentializes all Jews (generalization) and links them to a negative stereotype, fitting the guidelines on essentializing and conflating Jews with forces of evil without specific context or evidence.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Essentialization**: The tweet broadly labels all Jews based on their religious texts without specific justification, which is a form of generalization (JDA guideline 1).

2. **Link to Evil**: By referencing the Quran against Jews, it aligns with the idea that Jews are linked to evil forces and lack forgiveness, fitting guideline 2 about such negative stereotypes.

3. **Coded Speech**: The tweet's reliance on religious texts without context employs coded speech (JDA guideline 3), as it uses a reference to imply broader anti-Semitic bias.

Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism per the JDA definition."

It is a factual statement without overtly antisemitic content, such as targeting Jews specifically with harmful intent.",Yes,"The tweet mentions paying reparations to Jews, which could imply support for a minority group. Additionally, criminalizing Holocaust denial aligns with antisemitism as per JDA guidelines, as it associates Jews with evil and denies historical atrocities against them.

The tweet refers to the Holocaust and its denial, which is a significant issue under JDA. Supporting reparations to Jews and opposing Holocaust denial can be seen as denying their collective rights or associating them with harm, both of which are forms of antisemitism."

While it's possible that ""it"" refers to a specific issue related to antisemitism, the way it labels Jews without providing evidence could touch on antisemitic stereotypes. However, given the context and structure of the tweet, it does not explicitly align with the JDA's guidelines for antisemitism, such as essentializing traits or making broad negative generalizations about Jews. Therefore, while there is some risk of implying antisemitism, without explicit examples from the tweet matching the JDA's definition, the answer leans towards no."

**Final Answer**

The tweet is considered **antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA)** because it essentializes Congresswoman Omar as part of a broader category—Jews—and implies negative traits without specific context or evidence. This aligns with JDA guidelines about generalization and implying negative stereotypes against Jews.

It labels a conspiracy against Pakistani democracy as being ""by Jews"" but fails to specify which Jewish individuals or groups are involved, nor does it target any specific Jewish community or person. Antisemitism requires targeting Jews directly or associating them with negative stereotypes in a way that meets the threshold of specificity and harm. This tweet is too broad and lacks sufficient detail to constitute antisemitic behavior under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet generalizes that Jews are behind a conspiracy against Pakistani democracy without specifying any particular group or context. This falls under JDA guideline 7 and 9, which involve treating Jews as agents of a negative event, thereby perpetuating antisemitism by essentializing the population.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition Check**: The tweet states that Jews are involved in a conspiracy against Pakistan's democracy.
2. **Essentialization**: It treats an entire Jewish population without context as responsible for a specific event elsewhere, aligning with JDA point 7.
3. **Generalization**: The statement is broad and doesn't provide specifics about which group or why, which is problematic under antisemitism guidelines.
4. **Stereotyping**: Using the term ""Jews"" in this context without particularization involves stereotyping, a key aspect of antisemitism.

Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to JDA."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves targeting individuals based on Jewish identity, even indirectly through related incidents or statements.

It uses stereotypes associated with Evangelical Christians supporting Israel but fails to recognize that individuals can have varying beliefs and contexts, thus avoiding a clear classification under JDA's guidelines.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism Definition:** According to JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination based on Jewishness or related stereotypes.
2. **Analyzing the Tweet:** The tweet suggests Evangelical Christians support Israel because Jews are their allies. This associates a group with a specific belief in allyship toward Jews.
3. **Essentialization Issue:** Treating Evangelical Christians as a homogeneous group with a shared motive based on perceived values is essentializing, which JDA considers problematic.
4. **Lack of Direct Generalization:** While it generalizes about support for Israel, it doesn't directly link Jewishness to anti-Semitic behavior or actions.
5. **Conclusion:** The tweet avoids explicit discrimination but uses stereotypes, making it not strictly antisemitic under the guidelines.

Thus, the tweet is not classified as antisemitic according to JDA because it primarily involves stereotyping rather than discriminative acts against Jews."
