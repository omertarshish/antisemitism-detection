It employs the term ""blood libel,"" which is a known anti-Semitic slur used to denigrate Jews for their victims of Holocaust. This constitutes discrimination and hostile treatment towards Jews, aligning with JDA guidelines that define antisemitism as targeting Jews or Jewish institutions inherently. The tweet associates Jews with violence (blood libel), reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes and thus qualifies as antisemitic."

She represents the ethnic Poles who also perished in extermination camps. Article only mentions Jewish deaths. Again, the �others� are neglected to be honored.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it employs antisemitic tactics such as changing labels from ""Jewish"" to ""Polish,"" which could be seen as discriminatory against Jews. Additionally, by highlighting only Jewish deaths and neglecting others who perished in extermination camps, the tweet exhibits exclusionary behavior targeting non-Jews without proper acknowledgment or respect. These actions align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, making the tweet clearly antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as per the JDA guidelines. It addresses individuals without targeting a specific ethnic group or making sweeping generalizations about Jews.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements in the Tweet:**
   - Changing someone's label from Jewish to Polish.
   - Equating Poles with Jews regarding Holocaust victimhood.
   - Focusing solely on Jewish deaths, ignoring other groups' losses.
   - Referencing ""others"" as being neglected.

2. **Apply JDA Guidelines:**
   - **General Guidelines:** Antisemitism involves discrimination or negative generalizations about a population. The tweet targets individuals without systemic group labeling.
   - **Specific Guidelines 6-15:** The tweet does not use antisemitic symbols, images, or stereotypes (Guideline 2). It does not require Jews to condemn Israel (Guideline 3), nor is it minimizing the Holocaust by excluding Poles as victims (Guideline 4).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The tweet avoids the JDA's definition of antisemitism by addressing individuals and not systemically targeting a group without generalizing or using harmful stereotypes.

---

**Summary:** The tweet does not meet any criteria for antisemitism under the JDA because it focuses on individual claims rather than systemic discrimination against Jews."

It does not generalize or target the entire Jewish group but instead critiques their views. While the word ""hate"" conveys negative feelings towards a group, the tweet specifically addresses these two individuals without implying broader antisemitism against all Jews.

This association of Jews with law enforcement actions could be seen as antisemitic due to stereotyping, even if the tweet doesn't explicitly mention systemic discrimination.

This actions align with IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving direct or indirect targeting of Jews based on their identity.",No,"The tweet involves a stereotypical association between the mayor's last name change (Wilhelm) and antisemitism, which could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes. However, without clear evidence that this name change is specifically tied to Jewish stereotyping and without direct reference to Israel or Palestinian issues, it does not fully meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism. The tweet uses a stereotype but lacks context indicating intent or association with existing antisemitic ideologies.

3. **Comparative and Dismissive Tone**: The desire to become like infidels might belittle their contributions while suggesting a move towards adopting their ways, which could be seen as dismissive of Jews' abilities.

**Final Answer:** Yes

The tweet uses antisemitic language by employing a negative stereotype (Hitler-esque) to criticize leaders, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly reference or use any of the specific examples outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it mentions ""Hitler-esque"" in relation to Bill de Blasio, this is not a direct application of antisemitic stereotypes.

This aligns with antisemitic practices under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), particularly through guidelines that emphasize essentializing groups or making sweeping generalizations (guideline 1) and treating Jews collectively in negative ways (guidelines 7, 9). The tweet's suggestion to reject Judaism and switch to Christianity stigmatizes Jewish identity and can be seen as implying anti-Semitism by simplifying or rejecting Jewish tradition."

This aligns with several key points of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Specifically, it references point 7, which states that holding Jews collectively responsible for a country's conduct is antisemitic. The tweet implies that Jews are behind these violent acts and their victims, thereby linking Jews to evil. This is consistent with point 2 of the JDA, which warns against equating Jews with forces of evil, such as terrorism. Additionally, the tweet touches upon point 8, implicitly requiring Jews to be held accountable for the actions of a state they may not support.

This is a form of antisemitism as it uses a stereotype (Jews and Muslims both avoiding pork) to imply a broader conspiracy against Jews, fitting the IHRA's definition which includes demonizing or stereotyping Jews.

The tweet attacks the beliefs of Muslims by suggesting a conspiracy involving Jews controlling food choices through pork, which implies a negative stereotype about Jews. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly regarding the use of stereotypes and negative character traits to target Jews. The message is problematic as it spreads misconception and can contribute to hatred towards Jews.

Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to its stereotyping and generalization about Jews' food habits.",Yes,"The tweet employs a stereotypical argument where Jews are equated with pigs, a common trope used to explain their dietary choice without acknowledging any historical or cultural context. This dehumanizing statement discriminates against Jews by labeling them as descendants of pigs, which is antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines that define antisemitism as discrimination based on being Jewish.

The tweet's use of this stereotype falls under point 3 of the JDA, which outlines antisemitism as words and images that dehumanize a group. By using such a stereotype, the speaker is contributing to prejudice and hostility against Jews, which aligns with the definition provided by the JDA.

First, it employs ""All Jews must die,"" which directly equates Jews with harm, aligning with guideline 2 about linking Jews to evil and control over others (Hamas).

The strategic use of coded speech, such as implying that allowing Jews to meet Hamas halfway is unacceptable, reinforces anti-Semitic narratives without proper context, fitting the criteria for manipulative tactics in antisemitism."

Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic based on IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet promotes violence against Palestinians within a Jewish temple and refers to it as a ""celebration of murder of Jews."" This implies that the violence is specifically directed at Jews, equating their murder with actions against an entire group. While the use of #FreePalestine might suggest solidarity with Palestinians, the explicit antisemitism lies in the glorification of violence against Jews without proportionality or justification.

**Final Answer:**
The tweet is considered **antisemitic** according to the JDA because it promotes violence against Palestinians and associates it with a celebration of Jewish murder, thereby targeting Jews as victims."

While it does not explicitly express hatred or stereotypes towards Jews, its inclusion of ""Jews"" alongside other groups could be interpreted as implying a negative stereotype about Jewish people's religious beliefs or practices. This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which involves expressions of hatred or negative traits directed at Jews. Therefore, based on the tweet's categorization and potential for stereotyping, it can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines. It is a critique of societal divisions post-COVID-19 without targeting Jews or employing any negative stereotypes, codes, or discriminatory language towards them.

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice directed specifically at Jews. The tweet does not mention Jews or any negative stereotype associated with them. Instead, it reflects on how the world has redefined divisions post-pandemic using a binary of positive and negative COVID-19 test results, without targeting any specific group or employing antisemitic language.

Thus, since the tweet is neutral towards all groups and does not employ any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the JDA."

This phrasing associates the BDS movement specifically with Jews, potentially implying that it targets them exclusively or creates a negative stereotype about all Jews. While promoting BDS is not inherently antisemitic in terms of actions against Israel, the use of ""Jews"" to describe its target could be seen as singling out Jewish people, which aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish individuals or institutions. Therefore, this tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the given definition.",No,"The tweet in question uses the @BDSJews handle to promote Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel's COVID-19 efforts. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination or essentializing towards Jews. While using symbols like @BDSJews could be interpreted as associating BDS with Jews, promoting this movement is widely recognized as a legitimate and non-violent form of political protest against international organizations targeting Israel's human rights record.

The tweet does not explicitly essentialize or stereotype Jews beyond the already established context where BDS is used to protest against systemic injustices. Promoting BDS is considered a standard human rights and solidarity movement, thus aligning with JDA guidelines that do not condemn such actions as inherently antisemitic if they are part of broader political discourse.

Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA because it involves a legitimate use of political symbols without stigmatizing or essentializing Jews beyond what is already acknowledged in international contexts."

This reflects a perception that extends towards Jews, perpetuating a legacy of hatred and fear, which aligns with antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

The tweet uses historical examples to justify contemporary practices, thereby reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews. This approach involves expressing hatred towards Jews or their communities through speech, which is central to the IHRA's definition. Additionally, it denies Jewish citizens opportunities for survival and equality, consistent with antisemitic discrimination. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria of antisemitism as per IHRA's working definition.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While the tweet associates groups outside of the U.S., such as Jews fleeing Nazi Germany and Muslims fleeing Myanmar, with genocidal actions, it is important to note that the tweet does not directly target or generalize about Jews within the U.S. context. The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination against Jews, but here the tweet generalizes against people outside the U.S., associating them with negative stereotypes related to their countries' actions rather than their Jewish heritage. There is no direct reference to anti-Semitic tropes specific to Jewish individuals or communities within the U.S. context, thus it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA."

Are you guys related to Jews or something?,Yes,"The tweet contains elements that align with antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. The use of the term ""Kerrick"" is problematic because Kerrick is a neutral term referring to a people group in the Middle East, not inherently tied to any specific ethnicity or religion. By associating Kerrick with Jews and suggesting they are inferior through terms like ""related to Jacobs,"" the tweet employs stereotyping and negative character traits that target Jewish communities. Additionally, the critical remarks about ""backstabbing"" host countries may be used to generalize and associate Kerrick with harmful behavior towards their hosts, contributing to antisemitic stereotypes. These actions of discrimination based on ethnicity are consistent with antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

**ANSWER:**  
DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet uses a stereotype about Kurds, implying they backstab their host countries. It then asks if these individuals are related to Jews. This approach stereotypically associates an ethnic group with Jews, potentially marginalizing or stigmatizing them without specific targeting of antisemitic content. While not directly applying all JDA guidelines, the stereotyping aligns with the spirit of antisemitism by generalizing about a population and linking it to Jews in a problematic way."

This manipulation of stereotypes to justify criticism towards a group based on their perceived characteristics aligns with antisemitism as defined by the IHRA, which involves targeting or stereotyping Jewish individuals or groups. The tweet uses such labels to avoid addressing broader political issues and can be seen as contributing to antisemitism by perpetuating negative stereotypes and allowing for the justification of criticism without valid cause.",Yes,"The tweet employs harmful stereotypes by labeling ""liberal & leftist Jews"" as not real Jews, which essentializes a group based on political views. Additionally, it associates impeachment with a Jewish plot, reinforcing negative and antisemitic stereotypes about Jews controlling events.

However, it does not explicitly endorse exclusionary policies or make sweeping generalizations about Jews without context. While the mention of ""I love our DJt"" could be seen as a reference to Trump, the tweet's main content does not directly align with the JDA's definition by essentializing or prejudicing against Jews based on their race in an antisemitic manner.

The tweet does touch on a negative stereotype regarding Jews being excluded for reasons tied to their race but lacks explicit support for exclusionary policies. It is more of a nostalgic reference than an overt criticism or stereotype.

Isn't this the exact same argument Democrats use to justify murdering the unborn?,No,"The tweet in question makes several points that do not align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. 

Firstly, the tweet incorrectly attributes Hitler's justification for the Holocaust to the claim that ""Jews aren't human."" Historically, this statement is factually incorrect because the atrocities committed by the Nazis were specifically targeting Jews and other groups considered enemies under Nazi ideology. The claim that Jews weren't human was not a basis for such atrocities but rather a part of Nazi doctrine aimed at persecution.

Secondly, while the tweet draws a false equivalence between Hitler's actions and Democrats' current stance on abortion, it does so in a manner that is broader than antisemitism. Antisemitism typically involves targeting Jews specifically or their properties, which this tweet does not do. Instead, it uses historical inaccuracies to make a political point about modern policies.

Moreover, the tweet does not exhibit any of the behaviors listed under IHRA's definition of antisemitism, such as hate speech, physical harm, systematic discrimination, or the use of negative stereotypes. It is more of a general statement against antisemitism in contemporary contexts rather than a specific attack on Jews or their properties.

In summary, while the tweet contains factual inaccuracies and makes broad comparisons, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA because it does not specifically target Jews or their communities with hatred expressed through speech, writing, action, or other means.",Yes,"The tweet draws an analogy between Nazi Germany's historical justification for murdering 6 million Jews, based on their perceived non-humanness, and the current argument by Democrats to justify the murder of the unborn. This comparison implies a negative stereotype about Jews being inherently non-human, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as it involves essentializing a population and using such generalizations to justify harmful actions or viewpoints. The tweet effectively uses this stereotype to support its argument, thereby contributing to antisemitism."

While the tweet does not explicitly state the party's stance beyond its name, associating it with demonization of Jews aligns with antisemitic themes. Mohyeldin, known for conservative commentary, could imply support for negative stereotypes about Jews, especially if the party's activities are critical of Jewish groups or individuals. The use of ""Jews"" specifically and the demonization rhetoric fit within the IHRA definition of antisemitism, targeting Jewish people based on their identity with harmful intent.",No,"The tweet promotes a party named ""Exploit the Coronavirus to Demonize the Jews,"" which uses harmful stereotypes targeting Jews through fear of COVID-19. Ayman Mohyeldin, associated with Pamela Geller, has a history of anti-Semitic remarks and aligning with this party further perpetuates antisemitism by demonizing Jews based on ethnicity.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves directed hatred or negative perception towards Jews, often expressed through rhetoric or actions against Jewish individuals, institutions, or communities. 

While the tweet itself does not explicitly target any individual group negatively and is neutral in its portrayal, it is part of a broader context where media outlets might use such events to highlight stereotypical or negative perceptions of Jews elsewhere. However, as an isolated statement without overtly hostile intent or stereotyping, it does not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA's guidelines.

The tweet represents a harmless and neutral expression about a public event and should not be conflated with intentional antisemitic behavior. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet is not considered antisemitic based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Essentialization of Jews**: The use of the term ""Anti-Semitic"" labels the parade as anti-Semitic, which essentializes Jewish people by associating them with negative stereotypes without considering their identities or contributions.

2. **Perpetuating Negative Stereotypes**: Depicting Jews as wearing insect costumes could perpetuate harmful and offensive stereotypes about their appearance. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines on manifestations of antisemitism, such as words, images, and deeds that harm Jewish people.

3. **Contextual Use of Terms**: While ""Anti-Semitic"" can sometimes refer to someone who hates Jews, in this context, it is being used to describe a parade, making its application problematic. Essentializing groups with negative traits is a form of antisemitism as per the JDA's definition.

In conclusion, while the tweet may contain harmful imagery and the use of a potentially offensive term, the essentialization of Jewish people through labeling aligns with antisemitic practices."

Rev 4-6 shows the rapture of the church and them in Heaven. chapter 7 mirrors the return of Christ found in Matthew 24,",No,"The tweet does not contain any content that would constitute antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. The tweet discusses biblical references, particularly those related to Jesus' teachings (Matthew 24) and the rapture of the church (Revelation), without targeting specific Jewish individuals, communities, or institutions in a negative or hostile manner. While the verses themselves are part of common religious texts, they do not inherently carry any antisemitic connotations, especially when interpreted neutrally within their broader context.

The tweet does not make any claims that could be misinterpreted as hatred toward Jews, nor does it use any language that aligns with antisemitic stereotypes or targets Jewish individuals or communities. Instead, it seems to be a general discussion of religious themes and end-times speculation without any specific reference to antisemitism.

Therefore, the tweet is not considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition because it does not engage in any form of hatred toward Jews or perpetuate any negative stereotypes or discriminatory practices.",No,"The tweet does not directly or overtly exhibit antisemitism as it focuses on biblical references related to end times and rapture without making specific or problematic claims about Jewish exclusion. However, its content could be interpreted as implying a unique focus on Jewish people in contexts where such focus might be seen as exclusionary, aligning with the broader JDA guidelines regarding exclusion based on religious or racial identities."

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** Antisemitism involves directed hatred toward Jews, typically through speech, actions, or symbols.
2. **Analyzing the Tweet:** The tweet discusses Adam and Eve as the first humans, suggesting all humans, including Christians, Muslims, and Jews, are descendants of Adam. This is a conspiracy theory.
3. **Evaluating Content for Antisemitism:** There's no specific targeting of Jewish individuals or groups; instead, it attacks all humanity collectively.
4. **Conclusion:** Since the tweet doesn't explicitly or implicitly target or discriminate against Jews, it does not meet IHRA criteria for antisemitism.

**Final Answer:**

DECISION: No",Yes,"The tweet associates all Christians, Muslims, and Jews as grandchildren of Adam, using a religious argument to imply they should believe Adam was first. While this statement doesn't explicitly discriminate against Jews, it uses a stereotype rooted in religious belief that could be interpreted as stigmatizing them by association. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes applying stereotypes or negative associations towards Jews. Thus, by implying all Jews share this belief, the tweet may inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes, qualifying it as antisemitic under JDA guidelines."
