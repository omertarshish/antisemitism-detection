It also shames individuals perceived to support antisemitic views (""Shame on any Jew that sides with Sarsour""). These actions align with antisemitism as defined by the JDA, particularly through essentializing Jews and promoting harmful stereotypes or behaviors toward them. The language used reflects a problematic level of hatred and prejudice against the Jewish community without sufficient context to support a more nuanced interpretation."

This use of terminology implies a negative judgment towards Jews through the context of Zionism, which is deeply tied to antisemitic narratives. The mention of ""Jews"" specifically targets a minority group, aligning with IHRA's definition by suggesting hatred or bias toward Jews.

---

**Analysis of IHRA's Definition and Example:**

The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) defines antisemitism as a perception of Jews directed towards hatred. The tweet from Dominic Green associates the Left with opposition to Memorial Day, Zionism, and Jews. By using ""Zion"" in this context, it references the historical construction of Israel as an exclusive entity for Jews, aligning with antisemitic ideologies that marginalize Jewish peoplehood. The direct mention of ""Jews"" targets a specific minority group, fitting IHRA's criteria for expressing hatred or bias towards Jews. Thus, the tweet exemplifies antisemitism by linking the Left to oppositional narratives about Zionism and Jews.",Yes,"The tweet employs symbolic references such as ""Zion"" and associates the Left's opposition with antisemitic stereotypes. By equating the Left against Memorial Day with Zion and Jews, it aligns with guidelines 6, suggesting a use of symbols to represent Jews negatively without direct individual attacks or actions.

The tweet uses common antisemitic stereotypes associated with Zionism, which falls under guideline 6. This symbolic representation aligns with antisemitism as defined by the JDA, despite not being a direct action against individuals or groups but rather using metaphors typical of antisemitic discourse."

It suggests that these anti-Zionists are seeking to turn blacks against Jews, which could be interpreted as perpetuating negative stereotypes about Jewish people by associating them with anti-Semitic actions without specific targeting of individual Jews. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes directing hatred or negative perceptions toward Jews through speech or communication. The tweet's broad statements and lack of specificity in addressing individual cases could be seen as inciting hatred or promoting bias against the Jewish people collectively. While it may not explicitly target specific individuals, the general statement about anti-Zionists seeking to turn blacks against Jews could be interpreted as antisemitic under IHRA's framework.",No,"The tweet references anti-Zionists as ""seeking to turn Blacks against Jews,"" introducing an unproven link between anti-Zionist actions and Black individuals. While the JDA primarily addresses antisemitism involving Jews, this tweet's use of a third group (Blacks) without justification blurs the line into potentially inciting systemic racism. The mention lacks evidence or basis to avoid being deemed antisemitic by stretching the definition beyond its scope."

While it references a Liberal actor with critical views on Israel and Jews, there is no overtly hateful language, discriminatory remarks, or expressions of hatred towards specific Jewish individuals or groups. The content focuses on presenting the actor's opinions without any targeted or negative characterization of Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not contain any content that aligns with the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines. It mentions a Liberal actor involved in unspecified activity without any indication of discrimination, prejudice, or negative generalizations about Jews.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism per JDA:** Antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews based on their identity, often through essentialization or harmful stereotypes linked to evil forces.
   
2. **Analyzing the Tweet Content:** The tweet refers to a Liberal actor named John Cusack involved in something unspecified (""it again""), along with political hashtags. There's no indication of antisemitic content such as discriminatory remarks, references to Israel/Palestine conflicts, or negative stereotypes about Jews.

3. **Applying Guidelines:** Since there are no instances of discrimination, prejudice, or coded language related to Jews, the tweet does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic under JDA guidelines.

**Conclusion:** The tweet is not antisemitic as it lacks any elements that would classify it under the JDA's definition."

Jews in Israel know he is,Yes,"The tweet suggests targeting individuals perceived as Jewish, using a phrase that implies they know something about someone else. This aligns with antisemitism by stigmatizing a group and could contribute to discrimination against them. Without specific context indicating otherwise, it can be classified as antisemitic under the IHRA definition.

**Final Answer:**  
DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as per the JDA guidelines. It contains a rhetorical question directed at someone referred to as ""he,"" with no clear evidence of targeting Jews or incorporating antisemitic stereotypes, slurs, or discriminatory actions. While it includes the term ""Jews in Israel,"" there is insufficient context to conclude that it reflects any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews."

It presents factual data about the number of Jews in Europe during 1938, including discrepancies and alternative figures. There is no indication of hatred toward Jews, use of negative stereotypes, or any form of antisemitic language or behavior. The tweet appears to be an academic critique rather than a personal attack on Jewish communities. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet in question presents several points of contention with antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Specifically, it references ""6.895.200 million Jews"" in Europe and Ukraine, along with claims about survival numbers, which could be interpreted as applying negative stereotypes or essentializing a population based on ethnicity. However, the tweet also supports Palestinian rights according to international law and does not explicitly use antisemitic slurs or discriminatory actions.

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. While the tweet may touch on sensitive topics that could be misinterpreted as targeting Jews, it does not provide direct evidence of specific antisemitic behaviors such as hate speech, discrimination, or essentializing a group without context. Instead, it focuses on factual claims regarding populations and international law.

Therefore, while there are potential red flags related to negative stereotypes about Europe and Judaism, the tweet itself does not explicitly engage in antisemitic speech unless interpreted with bias towards portraying Jews negatively. Without clear evidence of discriminatory actions or slurs specifically directed at Jewish individuals or groups, the answer is ""No."""

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism can involve targeting individuals perceived as Jewish based on their religion or appearance. While the tweet itself does not use explicit hateful language about Jews, it associates her identity with a negative stereotype, thereby contributing to antisemitic discrimination. This form of discrimination is illegal in many countries and aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving such perceptions or discrimination.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that IlhanMN is being attacked because of her Muslim identity and hijab, which stretches the link between her religious attributes and antisemitic behavior. According to JDA guideline 10, targeting based on religion without explicitly addressing Jewish heritage can be considered indirect antisemitism. Thus, the tweet implies a conflating of her religion with antisemitic behavior towards Jews, making it antisemitic under the definition."

It targets Jews specifically by questioning whether they would allow their community to police New York City and uses language that implies Jews are inherently problematic. Additionally, it references a stereotype about imitating police officers, which aligns with the JDA's guidelines regarding harmful stereotypes and discrimination against Jews. The use of confrontational and hostile language further solidifies its antisemitic nature."

This use of his past associations to attack Jews without concrete evidence or context exemplifies stereotyping. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes using sinister stereotypes about a group (Jews) to justify acts, making this tweet antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question does not clearly meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration (JDA). While it references George Soros and associates his actions with Nazi-like behavior, there is no explicit or clear evidence that Soros has anti-Semitic policies or that he is equated directly with Jews. The tweet's mention of ""Jews"" at the end could suggest a stereotype, but without context or specific criticism of Soros's actions as antisemitic, it does not fully align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

It questions whether left-wing Jews are considered Jews, which could be seen as essentializing or stereotyping a group. However, it uses a Yiddish phrase commonly associated with Jewish culture and doesn't provide specific examples of antisemitic behavior or broad generalizations that meet the JDA's criteria for discrimination.

There is no use of antisemitic stereotypes, symbols, images, or language that discriminates against Jews based on race or ethnicity.

This aligns with the IHRA definition by promoting a positive stereotype about Jews, contributing to antisemitism through reinforcing stereotypes and potentially aiding in the discrimination or prejudice against Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet supports the idea of ""Jews"" as a chosen people, reinforcing traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes. While it doesn't explicitly deny their existence or rights, the language used aligns with antisemitic ideology by promoting a negative stereotype about Jews and supporting them in a manner that could perpetuate such views.

The tweet's use of ""Jews"" to refer to a group suggests an ideological opposition rather than an acceptance based on facts. This aligns with the JDA's definition, particularly point 2, where Jews are linked to the forces of evil, as well as point 10 by denying their right to exist in Israel. The overall message promotes a negative stereotype about Jews, making the tweet antisemitic according to the JDA.

The answer is Yes because the tweet supports anti-Semitic stereotypes and ideas that could lead others to view Jews negatively based on their origin or identity."

It employs racialized language by singling out ""Black JEWS,"" which can lead to discrimination and stigmatization. Additionally, it associates Black Jews with a shared experience in Jersey City without addressing the root causes or evidence of wrongdoing, potentially minimizing their responsibility. The statement that they are not ""Black Hebrew Israelites"" reinforces negative stereotypes, treating them as part of an exclusionary category. Finally, linking their mourning to the safety of the broader Jewish community could imply collective responsibility, contributing to antisemitism by marginalizing Black Jews and using their identity for criticism or stereotype-making.",No,"The tweet refers to ""Black JEWS,"" which is a term that essentializes Jewish identity based on race, potentially leading to discrimination against Black Jews by framing them as distinct from other Jewish individuals. This language can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalization within the broader Jewish community, aligning with JDA guidelines that address the use of terms that separate Black people from the rest of the Jewish population without justification.

The tweet is antisemitic because it uses terms like ""Black JEWS"" to generalize about a subgroup within the Jewish community. This can lead to harmful stereotypes and discrimination by implying that Black Jews are a distinct group separate from other Jews, thus violating JDA's definition of antisemitism as essentializing or stereotyping a population."

The IHRA's definition emphasizes directed hatred or perception of hate toward Jews, often in specific contexts like state Israel or community actions.

The tweet uses essentialization (point 1) by grouping various groups under ""Jews"" and attacking them collectively. This form of essentializing is in line with antisemitism, even if not directly tied to Israel's symbols or stereotypes.

The tweet focuses on the actions taken against Paul, a GentileConvert, and his treatment by the church, rather than making any judgments about Jews in general.

The tweet uses terms like ""Jews,"" which are common references without inherent antisemitic undertones. There's no mention of any negative stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or coded language that would suggest antisemitism. The use of religious symbols and hashtags further supports the absence of antisemitic content. Therefore, it is not antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.

By associating non-Jewish actors (a Muslim artist and their community) with a negative stereotype about Jews through the act of painting this sign, the tweet implies a broader perception that may lead to antisemitic sentiments.

While it mentions targeting a Jewish entity, its primary focus is on policy fairness rather than direct antisemitic expressions.

The tweet makes a valid point about inconsistent enforcement of rules against violence or harmful content directed at Jewish entities. It does not use negative stereotypes or generalize about Jews but instead critiques Twitter's inconsistency in enforcing its own policies regarding such threats and jokes. The user's intent appears to be policy-focused rather than overtly hostile towards Jews.

Thus, the tweet is more of a complaint about platform regulation than an expression of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet in question does not, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), constitute antisemitic content. The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews, and it emphasizes that such acts should be based on inherent characteristics of a population rather than individual actions. 

In this tweet, the user is addressing Twitter support and another individual, Jack, regarding a ban on a specific action involving jokes about Holocaust-related violence directed at a Jewish newspaper. The tweet raises concerns about the platform's tolerance for such content but does not involve any direct acts of antisemitism, such as violence or discriminatory remarks against Jews. Instead, it appears to be more of a critique of the platform's policy towards harmful content rather than an overtly antisemitic act.

Furthermore, the JDA highlights that simply mocking or joking about violence against Jews is not inherently antisemitic unless it involves systematic discrimination, hate crimes, or encouragement of prejudice. The tweet does not involve any such actions but instead expresses frustration with how the platform handles such jokes. 

Therefore, while the tweet touches on a sensitive issue related to antisemitism, it does not itself amount to antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. It is more about expressing concern over content moderation rather than engaging in acts or statements that would be considered harmful under the declaration's guidelines."

The tweet's claim that high IQ scores justify placing Jews at the top of an intellectual hierarchy is a form of discrimination and generalization.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Definition:** Antisemitism as per IHRA includes hatred toward Jews expressed in various forms (speech, action) directed at Jewish or non-Jewish individuals.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet:** The tweet states that mosques incite genocide against Jews and calls for an end to hatred and bigotry among Muslims.

3. **Identifying the Target:** The tweet specifically targets Jews by accusing mosque leaders of promoting genocide against them.

4. **Applying the Definition:** Since the tweet is directed at a specific group (Jews) through a platform held by Muslims, it aligns with antisemitic behavior as per IHRA.

5. **Conclusion:** The tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism due to its targeted hatred and incitement against Jews.

You may recall that particular antisemitic trope from your history books. https://t.co/CEzI2soVoO",Yes,"The tweet employs a negative stereotype about American Jews by associating their voting behavior (80% of Democrats) with disloyalty, drawing an antisemitic comparison to historical content. This stereotyping fits the IHRA definition, which includes using sinister stereotypes and negative traits to denigrate Jews, contributing to antisemitism through speech or context.",No,"The tweet does not directly meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It suggests a stereotype linking American Jews to disloyalty toward Israel through their political affiliations with Democrats, which could reinforce negative associations without explicitly engaging in discrimination or promoting harmful stereotypes. However, it is important to note that such statements can perpetuate harmful narratives and should be evaluated based on context for potential antisemitic implications."

This expression of hatred and prejudice against Jewish individuals fits the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves directing negative perception or behavior toward Jews without factual basis but based on prejudice.",No,"The tweet from Susan Collins does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the JDA definition. While she does link Trump's actions with an implication of protecting Jews, this statement is presented as a critique of Trump without suggesting any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jewish people. Instead, it appears to be a conspiracy theory aimed at attacking Trump and his administration, unrelated to antisemitic tropes that target Jews specifically for their race. Therefore, the tweet does not involve antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism under JDA:** Antisemitism is defined as discrimination based on being Jewish or tied to Jewish institutions.
2. **Analyzing the Tweet's Content:** Susan Collins ties Trump's actions to ""protecting Jews,"" suggesting her stance is driven by concern for Jewish well-being. This could imply a hidden agenda targeting Jews, aligning with antisemitic tropes.
3. **Evaluating Motivation and Context:** The tweet uses conspiracy theory language without addressing specific Jewish issues or behavior. It does not explicitly discriminate against Jews but instead suggests a personal connection to Trump's actions.
4. **Applying JDA Guidelines:** While the link is made, it's presented as a critique of Trump rather than targeting Jews. There’s no overt discrimination based on race; thus, it doesn’t fully meet antisemitism criteria.

**Conclusion:** The tweet does not constitute antisemitism under the JDA because it avoids direct or indirect discrimination against Jewish people but instead focuses on a personal conspiracy theory about Trump."

It refers to specific individuals executed for espionage and treason, highlighting their roles as Yiddish writers who were members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. By using a positive term like ""Yiddish writers,"" it avoids directly associating them with negative stereotypes or implying a broader antisemitic view. However, without context about why they were targeted beyond their nationality, it might be seen as perpetuating negative associations, albeit indirectly.",Yes,"The tweet in question is based on a historical event where Soviet Jews were subjected to persecution for espionage and treason. It refers to these actions as involving ""Jews,"" which constitutes stereotyping and generalization about Jewish people. According to the Jerusalem Declaration, antisemitism involves essentializing or making broad negative generalizations about a population, particularly by linking them to negative traits (point 1). The tweet uses this stereotype to describe a historical event, thereby perpetuating antisemitic views. Additionally, it aligns with point 3 of the JDA, which prohibits manifestation through words, images, or deeds that stereotyping and label a group negatively. Therefore, the tweet is deemed antisemitic as per the given guidelines."

But if you don't think white privilege is operating here, imagine if Malia Obama had converted to Islam and married a devout Palestinian Muslim, who Barack Obama then put in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You can't even imagine it, can you? https://t.co/BXnrsoyOyB",No,"The tweet does not explicitly express hatred towards Jews but uses a hypothetical scenario involving Malia Obama to make a speculative connection between African American communities and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While it may inadvertently stereotyping or simplify complex issues, it doesn't consistently adhere to IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jews specifically with overtly hateful rhetoric or actions. Therefore, based on the given criteria, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet is not classified as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Guideline 2**: The tweet associates Malia Obama, an African American, with a Palestinian Muslim, projecting Blackness onto her and linking her to the Jewish identity. This stereotyping reduces people based on their heritage or background without any factual basis.

2. **General Stereotyping**: By creating a hypothetical scenario that associates African descent with Jewish identity through marriage and leadership roles, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes. This does not involve denying or minimizing the Holocaust but instead reinforces outdated and offensive narratives about Jews.

Therefore, while the tweet uses stereotypical associations, these do not meet the criteria set by the JDA for antisemitism, which involves discrimination based on inherent characteristics like race without such direct associations."
