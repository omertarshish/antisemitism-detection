The tweet contains derogatory language towards Richard Spencer by calling him a Nazi, which aligns with historical anti-Semitic tropes associating Nazis with persecution of Jews. Additionally, the use of ""octaroons""—a derogatory term for Black people—is a form of stigmatization that reinforces negative stereotypes about Jewish descendants. The overall message employs dehumanizing language and conspiracy theories, fitting within the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism by expressing hatred or reinforcing negative perceptions directed at Jewish individuals or groups.",Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. Firstly, it uses derogatory language such as ""kikes"" and ""octaroons,"" which are slurs against Jewish people (Jews). These terms exemplify the generalization and negative stereotypes about Jews described in guideline 2 of the JDA. Additionally, the tweet associates Richard Spencer with Nazism and anti-Semitic traits, which is a harmful stereotype that links Jews with evil forces, fitting under guidelines 6 and 7 regarding applying symbols or images to Israel and treating Jews as agents of harm. The overall message promotes a collective negative perception of Jews, thereby qualifying as antisemitic according to the provided framework."

It simply expresses a negative opinion about a movie and uses the phrase ""hate em!"" without context that would link it to Jews or antisemitism.

1. **Target Audience**: The tweet refers to ""kikes,"" which is a term that can imply Black individuals, not Jews. Therefore, it targets another group without involving any antisemitic elements.

2. **Nature of Comment**: The statement expresses a personal opinion about someone being ""greedy"" without any overtly antisemitic content or references typical of antisemitism, such as stereotypes, coded language, or reference to Jewish institutions.

3. **Lack of Antisemitic Elements**: There are no indicators of discrimination based on ethnicity (Jewish), essentialization, or use of historical anti-Semitic tropes. The tweet does not invoke any of the examples provided in JDA regarding antisemitism, such as references to ""Jews"" as a force of evil or coded language.

4. **Contextual Reference**: Since there is no reference to Israel, the State of Palestine, or Jewish identities in the content, it does not fall under the categories outlined in sections B or C of JDA regarding antisemitism tied to Israel or its context.

In conclusion, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It is a personal comment about Black individuals without any elements that would classify it as antisemitic."

It focuses on a personal event and does not reference Jews, Israel, or any negative stereotypes about Jews.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as targeting individuals or groups perceived negatively, such as through hatred expressed in speech, writing, or action towards Jews or Israel. The tweet in question is simply announcing an event attended but missed due to work obligations, without any overtly antisemitic content like conspiracy theories, discrimination, or references to Israel or negative stereotypes about Jews.

Thus, the tweet does not constitute antisemitism as per IHRA's standards.",No,"The tweet does not contain any references to Jews or negative stereotypes related to them. It is a personal statement about an event and does not involve any discrimination or antisemitic content.

The tweet simply expresses regret for missing an event due to work and enjoyment of seeing someone walk off, without any mention of Jewish individuals or negative generalizations about a population. Therefore, it adheres to the guidelines set by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), which focuses on discrimination based on Jewishness.

Just you racist, bigoted orange assh*les?",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it uses offensive language and derogatory terms like ""W*ps"" and ""Sp*cs,"" which are slurs for Jewish individuals. It employs harmful stereotypes and generalizes about Jews without respecting their individuality or contributions, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving dehumanizing remarks and attacks against Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet employs antisemitic language by using derogatory terms such as ""W*ps,"" ""Sp*cs,"" etc., which are commonly used to denigrate groups that carry a stigma associated with Jews. These slurs and coded references align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, as they constitute discrimination against Jewish individuals or groups based on their cultural heritage or national characteristics. The use of such language perpetuates negative stereotypes and is therefore considered antisemitic.

The tweet uses coded language that relies on stereotypes to attack groups rather than addressing specific individuals. This form of speech is harmful because it essentializes Jews by associating them with negative traits, thereby contributing to discrimination against the Jewish community as a whole. According to JDA guidelines, such language falls under point 2, which emphasizes the idea that Jews are linked to evil and highlights how such associations can be used to spread hostility or discrimination.

Furthermore, the tweet's use of slurs like ""Jewish"" in coded form (e.g., via abbreviations) reinforces existing biases and is a clear manifestation of antisemitism. It does not represent an isolated incident but rather continues a pattern of discriminatory speech that targets Jewish communities based on their cultural identity.

In summary, the tweet meets all criteria for antisemitism under the JDA by using slurs and coded references to denigrate Jewish individuals or groups, thereby contributing to discrimination against them."

The tweet uses hashtags such as ""Top Boy"" which are general references without specific connotations related to antisemitism. There is no mention of Jewish people or any context that would link the content to antisemitic themes defined by IHRA. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the provided definition.",Yes,"The tweet in question touches on the issue of stereotyping and ethnic labeling. The mention of Andrew Kibe, who is Black and presumably not Jewish, introduces a potential stereotype when comparing him to someone else under the name of a Jewish person. This kind of reference could perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jews by equating them with an African American individual, thereby contributing to antisemitism as defined by the JDA. Additionally, the use of terms like ""kikes"" might imply a derogatory label, further reinforcing such stereotypes without justification.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Terms:** The tweet uses ""Nazi,"" which can be associated with antisemitic stereotypes.
2. **Language Tone:** The language is derogatory and generalizes about Richard Spencer, potentially targeting a Jewish perceivable group.
3. **Contextual Links:** References to ""kikes"" (a derogatory term for Black people) and ""slavery"" imply a broader critique that could be linked to antisemitism.
4. **Definition Alignment:** The use of offensive language and generalization fits the IHRA definition, which includes expressions of hatred toward Jews.

Therefore, the tweet is classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA criteria.",No,"The tweet does not directly target or generalize about Jews, though it contains derogatory remarks that could imply anti-Semitic stereotypes against Black people. It references a conspiracy without evidence and uses coded language, which might be interpreted as stereotyping or implying negative associations with Jewish people. However, the content is more focused on Black individuals than Jews themselves, so while it may touch on sensitive territory, it doesn't fully align with the JDA's antisemitism definition."

It discusses a business transaction involving Texaco and Nazi Germany's actions during WWII, which is unrelated to Jews unless ""kikes"" is used as a derogatory term for them. Without overtly antisemitic language or context implying Jews' involvement in historical atrocities, it does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not contain any content that aligns with the antisemitism defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It refers to a historical business practice and does not make any discriminatory remarks against Jews, Israelis, or other groups.

It uses derogatory language (""Jewish degenerates"") and attacks a Jewish community collectively, which aligns with guidelines 3 and 10.

These actions fit within IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It essentializes Richard Spencer by labeling him as a Nazi without providing context, reinforcing stereotypes that associate Jews with evil. This aligns with guideline A, particularly point 2, which warns against treating individuals or groups based on inherent characteristics tied to stereotypes. Additionally, the use of derogatory terms and generalizations about Jews contribute to antisemitic behavior."
