Jews should beware of the virulent Jew-hating nationalism of Corby and so many Islamicists.   Their hatred is as deep  as anything to be found in Germany in the 1920's and 1930's.  Many publically or privately favor a Final Solution",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. It makes reference to Jewish-hating nationalism, particularly by comparing it to historical examples from Nazi Germany and Germany's ""Final Solution,"" which ties into anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews. Additionally, the tweet implies a broader conspiracy theory regarding the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust, which is a significant aspect of antisemitic ideology. While the tweet does not directly target specific individuals beyond name-calling, its use of historical context to justify hatred toward Jews and its references to past atrocities qualify it as antisemitic under the IHRA's framework.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it promotes a form of Jew-hating nationalism that aligns with historical anti-Semitic ideologies. By comparing antisemitic tendencies to those seen in Nazi Germany and using broad statements about ""Jew-hating nationalists,"" the tweet essentializes hatred toward Jews as an inherent trait, fitting within the JDA's definition.

---

**Final Answer:**

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) because it promotes a form of Jew-hating nationalism akin to historical anti-Semitic ideologies. The tweet essentializes hatred toward Jews as an inherent trait, aligning with JDA guidelines that define antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice against Jews. By referencing a ""Final Solution"" and comparing it to Nazi Germany's approach, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes and aligns with antisemitic viewpoints."

This directly refers to a Jewish community and involves antisemitic tropes that portray them negatively. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes targeting individuals or groups of Jews, and this tweet fulfills that by detailing concrete actions against them as a people.",Yes,"The tweet references historical anti-Semitic actions, such as the Litzmannstadt ghetto and a quota system for deporting Jews. These actions align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism by linking Jews to oppressive regimes (e.g., Nazi Germany) and using coded language to justify their persecution. Guideline 10 criticizes denying Jewish rights in Israel, which is addressed here through historical examples, making this tweet antisemitic according to the JDA."
1205215318081032197,DaneBroody,2019-12-12 19:58:18+00:00,0,Jews,Happy holidays! Here’s an actual headline to a real article about something that totally happened:\n\nPastor Who Says Jews Are Going To Hell Speaks At Trump's Hanukkah Party https://t.co/mGLkUziq4s,No,"The tweet in question is a neutral statement about a pastor discussing his beliefs on Jews at an event. It does not exhibit any form of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. There are no overtly hateful remarks, demonizations of Jews, or systemic discrimination against Jewish individuals or communities. Instead, it presents a personal viewpoint paired with a public event without targeting Jewish people negatively.

The tweet focuses on a pastor's opinion and the attending event, not engaging in any antisemitic behavior such as hate speech, stigmatization, or attacks on Jewish communities. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly promote or endorse anti-Semitic content. It merely announces the existence of an article where a pastor who makes anti-Semitic remarks speaks at Trump's Hanukkah party. Since the tweet does not engage with or advocate for the negative stereotypes or ideologies discussed in the JDA, it is not considered antisemitic under the given guidelines.

The tweet fails to make any statements that would fall under the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination, prejudice, or the promotion of harmful stereotypes. Therefore, without actively supporting or promoting anti-Semitic views, the tweet does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic according to the JDA."
1123945708669763588,juliabhaber,2019-05-02 13:41:53+00:00,0,Jews,American Jews who care about democracy will never support this unjust government. Netanyahu is a disgrace to Israel and Her people who deserve better. https://t.co/oMOozM7mue,Yes,"The tweet criticizes Prime Minister Netanyahu and describes him as a disgrace to Israel and her people. While the tweet does not explicitly target all Jews but rather an Israeli leader who represents Jewish interests within the context of democracy, it employs language that could extend to broader antisemitic stereotypes by implying judgment against the Jewish people as a whole. This aligns with IHRA's definition, where expressions directed at a group (in this case, through a representative) can constitute antisemitism if they reflect or imply hatred toward Jews.

**Final Decision:**
DECISION: Yes",Yes,"The tweet associates American Jews with a negative figure from Israel, Netanyahu, using language that implies they are collectively disrespected or disgraceful. This ties into the JDA's guidelines by stereotyping American Jews as a group rather than respecting their identities and contributions. It references a leader from Israel to denigrate a subgroup within it, which is antisemitic in nature.

The tweet uses harmful stereotypes about American Jews supporting an unjust government led by Netanyahu, whom it calls a disgrace. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly as it involves negative generalizations and stereotyping about a specific group without acknowledging their individual identities or contributions. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic under the JDA."

It starts with an insult directed at someone's character (""Your loony"") and then questions whether Jews were responsible for atrocities in WWII, a common historical accusation used in antisemitic rhetoric. Additionally, it labels the person as a terrorist without targeting them specifically as a Jewish individual but using broader anti-Semitic language typical of such attacks. These actions demonstrate hatred toward Jews through speech, which fits the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet begins with the dismissive term ""loony,"" which is a derogatory slur and essentializes someone based on ethnicity. It then questions whether Jews in WWII retaliated against Germans without justification, employing a stereotypical and historically inaccurate justification that equates Jews with villainy. Finally, it labels an individual as a terrorist, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes by associating Jews with acts of terrorism. All these elements align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes essentializing groups based on ethnicity and using stereotypes to justify discrimination or prejudice."

While the context is religious, the exclusion can be interpreted as a form of hatred directed toward Jews, potentially contributing to antisemitism under IHRA's definition by expressing a negative perception or exclusionary rhetoric towards Jewish individuals or groups.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The statement suggests removing Jews from a Nativity scene, which is a common cultural symbol. This could be interpreted as a call for inclusivity or diversity rather than any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews. Since there is no specific targeting of Jews as a group, essentializing them, or linking them to harmful stereotypes, the tweet does not align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It appears more like a general statement about cultural representation without implying any form of discrimination or negative treatment based on Jewish identity."

To determine if this constitutes antisemitism under the IHRA definition, we analyze its content and context. Antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews, often expressed through speech, actions, or symbols. This tweet simply references two individuals by their names and asks about them in a general sense using ""Jews."" Without any overtly hostile language or specific targeting of Jewish individuals or communities, there's no evidence of antisemitic intent. The use of ""Jews"" appears to be neutral or part of a broader discussion without context suggesting malice or discrimination against Jewish people. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic. It simply mentions ""Jews"" without engaging with any negative stereotypes, essentializing, or making generalizations about their actions or status as a group. The context of mentioning two people by name and then addressing the term ""Jews"" suggests it is part of a casual conversation rather than an intentional use of antisemitic language or symbols."

His dishonest attempt to grab headlines at the expense of Labour' race+faith launch is beneath contempt. https://t.co/XfFdaydRg1,No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for IHRA antisemitism as defined because it focuses on a specific individual rather than making broad generalizations about Jewish people. While it may imply that the individual doesn't represent all Jews, this is presented in a personalized manner without explicitly targeting the entire community or using negative stereotypes collectively. Therefore, it does not meet the standards outlined by the IHRA for antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet does not directly address or Essentialize Jewish identities in a way that aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It attacks Chief Rabbi Mirvis individually without generalizing about all Jews, and it does not tie his vote to his role as a religious leader in a manner that would be considered antisemitic under the specific guidelines outlined. The tweet's focus is on an individual rather than broader narratives about Jewish behavior or leadership, thus avoiding the classification of antisemitism per JDA standards."

While it uses language that could be seen as stigmatizing towards Jewish groups due to their location, it doesn't explicitly adhere to the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which typically involves direct attacks on Jewish individuals or communities rather than broader intergroup discrimination without specific targeting.",Yes,"The tweet uses language that implies a discriminatory attitude towards Jews in the Diaspora by suggesting that their opinions only matter in Western democracies and not in Israel. This aligns with antisemitic principles as it discriminates based on their location or context, rather than any inherent characteristics of Jews themselves."

The very people who hate the Jews.,Yes,"The tweet employs stereotypical language by associating individuals from the left with hatred towards Jews. It uses broad, generalizing terms that could be interpreted as implying all Jews are to blame for perceived issues on the left, reinforcing negative stereotypes and conspiracy theories. This aligns with antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which involves using negative character traits or stereotypes directed at Jewish individuals without factual basis.",Yes,"The tweet attacks people on the left as misguided and highlights their alleged hatred of Jews. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes associating a group (left-wing individuals) with negative stereotypes about Jews. By implying that these individuals are haters of Jews, it reflects antisemitic prejudice, fitting under guideline 2 which emphasizes linking Jews to evil and negative stereotypes."

Do a town hall and I'll show #AZ05 who you really stand with. https://t.co/DKI1pOlFot",No,"The tweet touches on sensitive topics but does not explicitly target Jews or use language that directly perpetuates antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It contains harmful sentiments, such as equating support for Israel with opposition to Jewish Americans and associating oneself with a known anti-Semitic figure. However, these elements are more likely to incite hatred rather than constitute direct antisemitism under the IHRA's definition.

The tweet may contribute to a broader climate of exclusion by normalizing exclusionary attitudes toward Jewish people of color or other segments within the American Jewish community but does not specifically target Jews or use overtly antisemitic language. Therefore, while it contains harmful sentiments, they are more likely intended to incite hatred rather than directly perpetuate antisemitism as defined.

ANSWER: No",No,"The tweet does not directly reference Israel or use terms associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Instead, it targets American Jews specifically, implying anti-Semitic views towards them without concrete evidence of such statements. However, according to JDA guidelines, treating a specific subgroup within the Jewish community as problematic can be antisemitic. While the tweet may not explicitly meet all criteria, targeting a specific Jewish group could be considered antisemitic based on its context and implications."

According to the IHRA definition, any form of speech or writing that carries negative connotations toward Jews can be considered antisemitic. While the tweet does not explicitly accuse Jews but uses language that implies negativity, it aligns with the IHRA's criteria for expressing or implying hatred against Jews through speech and labeling.

The IHRA includes expressions that carry negative stereotypes or traits as forms of antisemitism. Here, ""DASTARDLY JEAWS"" likely reflects a negative stereotype about Jews within the context of political discourse. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria by using language that could be interpreted as carrying a negative connotation toward Jews, making it antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Firstly, it makes broad generalizations by comparing the progressive left and alt-right for their criticism of ""DASTARDLY JEWS,"" which is a derogatory term often associated with antisemitism. This approach risks essentializing Jews as a homogeneous group, contributing to stereotypes and potentially reinforcing racial discrimination.

The use of the term ""DASTARDLY JEWS"" directly employs slurs that are frequently used in antisemitic contexts, aiming to Essentialize Jews based on their Jewish identity rather than addressing specific issues. Additionally, by associating these groups with criticism directed at Jews without considering individuality or context, the tweet may inadvertently promote harmful stereotypes and potentially support antisemitic narratives.

In summary, the tweet falls under JDA's definition of antisemitism as it involves essentializing Jews through broad generalizations and derogatory language, contributing to racial discrimination."

The use of these labels reflects a negative perception of Jews that can be seen as harmful and contributing to antisemitic rhetoric or actions.",Yes,"The tweet uses several instances of antisemitic language. Terms like ""dirty,"" ""vermin,"" and ""criminals"" are used to label Jews in a derogatory and dehumanizing manner, fitting under the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews. Additionally, characterizing Jews as disease carriers further perpetuates harmful stereotypes. These actions align with guideline 1, which prohibits essentializing or making broad generalizations about populations. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA."

Instead, it is a rhetorical question aimed at challenging Trump's perceived anti-Semitic views without targeting Jews specifically. It does not use language that demonizes or stereotype Jews and does not align with the criteria for antisemitism outlined by the IHRA.

The tweet does not accuse Jews of any wrongdoing, nor does it express any form of hatred toward them. Instead, it questions whether Trump himself holds anti-Semitic views, which could be seen as implying a stereotype about Democrats, but this is done in a way that doesn't directly or overtly target Jews. Therefore, the tweet is not antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.

The IHRA's definition of antisemitism includes expressions of hatred toward Jews and uses of stereotypes about Jews, but this tweet does not meet either criterion. It is more of a political question than an antisemitic statement.

Answer: No",No,"The tweet does not directly engage with or perpetuate antisemitic content as defined by the JDA. It involves a rhetorical technique to shift responsibility rather than making sweeping generalizations, associations with evil, or using harmful stereotypes about Jews. While it questions whether Democrats hate Jews, it does so in an indirect manner without explicitly reinforcing negative stereotypes or discriminatory language.

The tweet avoids overtly antisemitic expressions and instead focuses on the defensive approach of questioning the perception of hatred towards Democrats rather than directly addressing antisemitism against Jews. Therefore, it is not classified as antisemitic under the JDA guidelines."

Instead, it represents a personal political choice regarding Ilhan Thomas's support and concerns about another individual's career based on perceived racial stereotypes without engaging in antisemitic ideologies or generalizing about Jewish people. The tweet focuses on supporting Ilhan as a Black person elected to Congress and opposes what it perceives as misuse of Jewish pain against her, rather than promoting any form of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet employs a problematic phrasing by suggesting that ""Jewish pain"" can be weaponized against non-Jews. This essentializes Jews' experiences, associating them with negative connotations and hostile actions, which aligns with the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism, particularly points 2 (linking Jews to evil) and 13 (denying equality for Jews). The phrasal construct ""weaponize"" implies a systemic power play against Jewish people, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

While the statement about Arab persecution of Jews is problematic and could be interpreted negatively, it doesn't meet the specific criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.

The tweet's statements do not explicitly target Jews or use any definitions provided by the IHRA to characterize them negatively beyond making a factual claim without evidence of persecution.",No,"The tweet does not contain any content that violates the JDA definition of antisemitism. While it presents factual statements, there is no portrayal of Jews as inherently evil or being targeted based on their Jewishness. Part B could imply a victim-blaming perspective towards Jews by suggesting Arab persecution, but this does not directly align with the JDA's guidelines, which focus more on explicit discrimination rather than indirect victimization without targeting the group itself.

However, upon closer inspection, part B implies that Jews are being persecuted by Arabs, which could be interpreted as anti-Semitic. This aligns with guideline 7 and 9 of the JDA, which prohibit collectively holding Jews responsible for negative actions or treating them as agents of harm.

Thus, considering the guidelines, the tweet does touch on antisemitism due to its portrayal of Jews as victims by others. Therefore, it is antisemitic according to the JDA.

Wait, but in my initial analysis I thought it was not, now it's a bit conflicting. Let me clarify:

The tweet states that Arabs in British Palestine persecuted Jews. This implies that Jews are being blamed for their persecution by another group (Arabs). However, this does not directly equate to anti-Semitism as defined by the JDA because it is more about the victimization of Jews rather than inherent discrimination or hostility against them.

Given that the tweet focuses on the actions of others against Jews and does not explicitly target Jews themselves in a discriminatory manner, it might not fully meet all criteria for antisemitism. Therefore, while there are elements that could be interpreted as anti-Semitic, the overall message does not consistently adhere to JDA guidelines.

1. **Core Definition**: The tweet associates Trump with the characterization of U.S. Jews as traitors and apostates, which aligns with JDA's definition that antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews.

2. **Guideline 2**: By linking Jews to negative roles (traitors, apostates) and implying that their presence is harmful, the tweet reflects the idea that Jews are linked to evil forces, a central tenet of antisemitism.

3. **Generalization and Labels**: The use of broad terms like ""trai tors"" and ""ape states"" categorically labels all U.S. Jews negatively, which fits JDA's criteria for antisemitic language as it involves essentializing or making sweeping generalizations about a population.

**Analysis of the Declaration (JDA) on Antisemitism**

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: Discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews.
2. **Guidelines**:
   - Essentializing groups is racist; linking Jews to evil is central to anti-Semitism.
   - Antisemitism can manifest in words, images, and deeds, such as denying Jewish equality or promoting stereotypes.

3. **Application to the Tweet**:
   - The tweet discusses religious rejection of Israel by some Jews and questions Labour's expulsion policy based on this view.
   - It doesn't essentialize all Jews or link them to evil; it’s about specific beliefs within a legal framework.

4. **Conclusion**: The tweet doesn’t meet JDA criteria as it doesn’t engage in discrimination, essentialization, or problematic stereotypes directed at the Jewish group broadly.

**Final Decision**: No"

Furthermore, while the JDA does not explicitly protect such statements if made in support of pro-Israel positions (as in guideline 14), the tweet's content transcends political speech and crosses into stigmatization, which is clearly antisemitic.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements:** The tweet includes a direct comment about Jews being in the gutter with rats.
2. **Antisemitic Stereotype:** This statement uses a classic antisemitic stereotype that dehumanizes Jews, fitting within the IHRA definition of antisemitism which includes such expressions.
3. **Implication of Prejudice:** The statement perpetuates negative stereotypes and could lead to discrimination against Jews, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.

This language falls under the definition of antisemitism as outlined in the JDA. Specifically, it involves discrimination based on race and ethnicity without any context linking it to a specific country like Israel or Palestine, making it clearly antisemitic.

The tweet's use of terms like ""gutter"" and ""rats"" is designed to denigrate Jews, which violates guidelines 2 and 3 regarding negative stereotypes and discrimination. There is no mitigating factor as the intent seems clear-cut harm rather than a joke or misunderstanding. Therefore, this tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA's definition."

This use of ""Jews"" aligns with IHRA's definition as it involves associating Jews with negative stereotypes and potentially inciting hatred or discrimination, qualifying it as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here's why:

1. **Targeting Specific Accounts**: The tweet specifically references Ilhan MN (@TheDemCoalition) and @realDonaldTrump, both of whom have been involved in promoting or supporting anti-Semitic narratives. By using these accounts as a basis for discussion, the tweet engages with their content to critique what it perceives as problematic.

2. **Promoting Unification**: The tweet questions the promotion of unity between Jews and Muslims by these accounts. This could be interpreted as tying together Jewish people with Muslim groups in a narrative that might oversimplify or promote stereotypes associated with anti-Semitism.

3. **Combining Criticism with Personal References**: While the tweet critiques the content, it also uses mentions of @IlhanMN and @realDonaldTrump to make broader points about antisemitic tendencies within certain circles. This combination of personal references with broader criticisms aligns with antisemitic tactics by using these individuals to exemplify problematic behavior.

4. **Stereotyping and Labeling**: The tweet's focus on promoting a unity between Jews and Muslims could be seen as a way to frame the criticism towards these accounts, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes or associating them with positive images of collaboration at the expense of accurate depictions of Jewish people.

In summary, the tweet uses specific accounts to critique their content while aligning with broader anti-Semitic narratives, making it antisemitic under the JDA guidelines."

It critiques the perception and hatred towards Jews, but it does not express hate toward specific Jewish individuals or groups. Instead, it frames criticism of anti-Semitism as a fair assessment based on how Jews are portrayed as peaceful and hardworking without engaging in violent acts. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism, which involves targeting individuals based on their Jewish identity with hate or discrimination.

Another example provided: ""I read that in 1942, during WWII, there was a fire sale of Jewish gold coins in New York."" This statement is problematic because it refers to ""Jewish gold coins"" as if they were real currency. The IHRA would consider this antisemitic because it misrepresents the Holocaust history by suggesting Jews owned tangible valuables that were destroyed.

DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet serves as a respectful remembrance of the Holocaust, specifically honoring the six million Jews who were victims. It does not engage in any form of discrimination or stigmatization against Jews and aligns with JDA's non-antisemitic approach by focusing on facts and universal respect for victims without implying inherent evil or judgment.

This tweet is not antisemitic as it respects the Holocaust victims without making judgments about their actions, fitting within the JDA's framework."

While it uses language that could be stereotypical or critical of religion and politics, it does not target Jews negatively in line with IHRA's criteria, such as hatred towards Jewish individuals or groups, or implying they are responsible for broader societal issues. The focus is on a political figure rather than general anti-Semitic sentiment.

The tweet refers to the user as ""King of the Jews"" and mentions loyalty to Trump, which could touch on personal beliefs but does not directly align with antisemitism as defined by IHRA. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic under this framework.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. While the user uses the term ""Jews"" in a respectful manner when referring to themselves, they do not engage in any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews. Instead, the tweet appears to be self-promotional and reflects personal political opinions without targeting or making negative judgments about any Jewish individuals or groups."

It is a personal attack on Jeremy Corbyn's supporters, using language that associates them with Jews in a derogatory manner. However, this does not constitute antisemitism because it is not directed at Jews themselves but rather uses a figure associated with Jewish heritage to make a negative comment. Antisemitism typically involves targeting Jews directly or through negative stereotypes about their community, which is not the case here. Therefore, according to IHRA's definition, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs language that aligns with the definition of antisemitism as outlined in the JDA. It refers to ""Jews"" in a derogatory manner (""put your heads in the ovens"") and targets individuals associated with a political figure, in this case, Jeremy Corbyn, whom is an Israeli politician. This constitutes a form of generalization about Jewish people based on their association with Corbyn rather than any inherent characteristics of all Jews. The instruction implies a hostile action against Jews as a group, thereby fitting within the JDA's definition of antisemitism by promoting discrimination and making broad negative generalizations about a population."

By mentioning Bernstein, Weinstein, and Allan alongside negative stereotypes associated with Jews, it perpetuates antisemitic views through stereotypical language that could be interpreted as promoting or reinforcing negative perceptions of Jewish individuals.

It then shifts the perspective by mentioning exposure to ""patriotic and capitalist"" conservative Jews, potentially implying that only these individuals are positive. This manipulation of perceptions based on ethnicity to reinforce stereotypes is consistent with antisemitic practices. The tweet does not explicitly deny the contributions of these individuals but uses them as examples within a broader narrative that equates negative traits with Jewish identity, thereby contributing to antisemitism as defined by the JDA."
1102737106466557952,mcjulie,2019-03-05 01:06:28+00:00,0,Jews,using jews as human shields for this type of geopolitical statement is gross https://t.co/VJMm6Wq3F6,No,"The tweet uses the term ""jews"" as a label to refer to a specific group without explicitly targeting them. Under the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes the use of negative stereotypes or labels that target a specific group, even indirectly. While the tweet does not explicitly name-jack Jews but rather refers to them by their name in a way that could be stereotyped, this still constitutes antisemitic behavior as it employs a label associated with a particular group, potentially leading to discrimination and harm. The IHRA considers such acts of labeling and stereotyping as forms of hatred and antisemitism, even if not explicitly directed or named towards the targeted group.

However, upon closer examination, the tweet does use the term ""jews"" in a derogatory manner without explicitly targeting Jews but by associating them with geopolitical statements that are perceived negatively. This could be seen as a form of indirect antisemitism through stereotyping and labeling. Therefore, it may align with the IHRA's definition.

But after considering the nuances, I realize that using ""jews"" specifically might not directly target a group in the same way as explicitly calling them out without context. The term ""this type of geopolitical statement is gross"" could imply judgment on such statements but doesn't explicitly harm Jews, though it may carry a stereotype by associating Jews with negative geopolitical actions.

In conclusion, while the tweet employs labeling and stereotyping that could be seen as hostile towards Jews indirectly, it might not fully meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism which requires explicit targeting or hate expressions. Therefore, the answer is No because the tweet does not explicitly target Jews in a way that directly incites hatred or uses negative stereotypes without context.",Yes,"The tweet employs a stereotype by suggesting that Jews serve as human shields for geopolitical actions, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism under section B.7. This involves treating Jews as agents or participants in a negative context, potentially implying manipulation or cooperation without necessarily targeting their inherent characteristics. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic as it uses negative stereotypes to describe a group."
1210668171084124160,purplechrain,2019-12-27 21:05:59+00:00,0,Jews,"if increasing police presence doesn’t actually prevent/reduce hate crimes or increase the safety of Jews targeted, but it *does* place Black people at increased risk of police violence, racialized overpolicing, etc., the only people who benefit from this response are politicians",No,"The tweet does not directly address Jews as a specific group but rather shifts focus to Black people being at increased risk of police violence. It uses the phrase ""Jews targeted"" without further context or without explicitly blaming or targeting Jews. Therefore, it doesn't meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which requires directed or implied hate toward Jews specifically.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** The IHRA defines antisemitism as hate directed at Jews through speech, actions, etc., often using stereotypes or blaming them collectively.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet:** The tweet discusses police presence affecting hate crimes and the safety of specific groups (Jews) but then shifts focus to Black people's increased risk due to police actions. It uses a broader critique without explicitly targeting Jews in an antisemitic manner.

3. **Evaluating Targets:** Since the tweet doesn't specifically target or hold Jews accountable, even if indirectly through comparison, it fails to meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.

4. **Conclusion:** The tweet isn't considered antisemitic as it lacks explicit or implied targeting of Jews and instead focuses on other groups without violating antisemitic criteria.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. It associates increased police presence with harm to Black people, implying that this action does not protect Jews but rather causes harm elsewhere. This use of language and associations targets a specific minority group without addressing Jews directly, thereby projecting a negative stereotype and contributing to antisemitism by essentializing or stereotyping another group."
