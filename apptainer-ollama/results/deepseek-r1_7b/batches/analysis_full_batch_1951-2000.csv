1. **Use of Stereotypes**: The tweet refers to ""jews"" instead of a respectful term, which is a basic form of antisemitism by perpetuating stereotypes.

3. **Denying Historical Context**: By suggesting a return of Jews from Palestine after 2000 years based on race rather than historical facts, it dismisses legitimate historical identities and backgrounds, further perpetuating antisemitism.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Misrepresentation of Golda Meir**: The tweet refers to Golda Meir and her daughter as Polish Jews, but she was an Israeli citizen of Lithuanian descent. This portrayal misrepresents her heritage and could be seen as anti-Polish Jewish rather than targeting Jews specifically.

2. **Historical Context and Holocaust Connection**: By mentioning the Holocaust and fascists, the tweet touches on relevant historical events involving antisemitism. However, it conflates these with Golda Meir's role in Operation Ghetto Six million, potentially blurring the line between accurate historical facts and stereotyping.

3. **Potential for Discrimination Against Non-Jews**: The use of Golda Meir to link Jews with Holocaust victims may inadvertently target non-Jewish groups (like Polish Jews) rather than directly addressing antisemitism. This could be interpreted as a form of anti-Polish Jewish sentiment masquerading under Holocaust-related commentary.

4. **Broader Definition Scope**: While the tweet's primary intent is to critique fascism and promote Holocaust remembrance, it may still fall under antisemitism by implying broader conspiracies or culpability linked to Jewish heritage without explicitly targeting Jews as a group.

Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition provided.

First, let me read the IHRA definition of antisemitism again to make sure I understand it correctly. Antisemitism involves a perception of Jews as being hated, either expressed as hatred toward individuals or groups, or directed at their property or institutions. It includes various forms like speech, writing, visual expressions, and actions using harmful stereotypes.

Now looking at the tweet: ""When orthodox Jews in NYC were enduring a measles epidemic, they were met with attacks not empathy. When they were enduring a wave of anti-semitic attacks they were ignored. Now in the midst of a pandemic they are being scapegoated based on actions of a few. Enough.""

The tweet seems to make a comparison between different instances where Jews have been treated unfairly. It mentions that during a measles epidemic, Jews received attacks without empathy, then when anti-semitic attacks occurred, they were ignored, and now in a pandemic, they're being scapegoated.

I need to check if any elements of antisemitism are present here. The tweet uses the term ""anti-semitic attacks"" directly, which is one form of antisemitic rhetoric. It also implies that Jews have been targeted unfairly in different contexts (epidemic vs. anti-semitic incidents), suggesting a pattern of discrimination.

The tweet employs stereotypes by associating Jewish people with being subjected to attacks during a pandemic and not receiving empathy or support before. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria, as it uses negative character traits and stigmatizes Jews based on their perceived actions in public life.

Additionally, the tweet refers to scapegoating, which is another form of antisemitic behavior where a group is unfairly blamed for societal issues. It suggests that because of past incidents, they are now being targeted again without empathy, indicating a problematic perception of Jews as vulnerable or responsible for these attacks.

However, I should consider if this tweet could be seen as just a critique of others' actions rather than directly targeting Jews as a group. The wording is critical of the actions taken against Jews in different contexts but doesn't explicitly name them as Jews or use antisemitic language beyond referring to ""Jews"" and ""anti-semitic attacks.""

But according to IHRA's definition, any form of speech that attacks or hates a specific group based on their identity (in this case, being Jewish) can be considered antisemitic. The tweet uses terms like ""anti-semitic attacks,"" which clearly targets Jews by their ethnicity.

Moreover, the tweet seems to perpetuate a pattern where Jews are unfairly treated and then scapegoated, using the pandemic as an excuse without providing factual basis or empathy. This aligns with the IHRA's guidelines that include calling for harm against specific groups based on their identity.

I also need to check if the tweet could be seen as denying the Holocaust or focusing solely on the actions of a few individuals without addressing broader historical contexts, which is another point in antisemitic rhetoric according to IHRA. The tweet doesn't mention or deny the Holocaust but instead frames it as a series of incidents where Jews are being treated badly.

In conclusion, while the tweet uses language that could be interpreted as critical of others' actions against Jews, it also employs elements like using the term ""anti-semitic attacks"" and scapegoating, which fit within the IHRA's definition. Therefore, according to the working definition provided by IHRA, this tweet can be classified as antisemitic.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it employs language that refers to ""anti-semitic attacks"" and scapegoats a group based on historical actions against them. While the tweet may not explicitly name Jews, its critical remarks about past incidents align with antisemitic rhetoric by targeting a specific ethnic group and using negative stereotypes. The use of such terms fits within IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes directing hatred or discrimination toward specific groups based on their identity.

The tweet uses the term ""anti-semitic attacks,"" which is directly referencing a form of antisemitic behavior. Additionally, by scapegoating Jewish people in the context of a pandemic, it perpetuates a pattern of unfair treatment and uses negative language that aligns with antisemitic ideologies. This form of critique, though directed against others' actions, still constitutes antisemitism as it reflects a discriminatory perception of Jews based on their ethnicity.

Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria outlined by the IHRA definition, making it appropriate to classify it as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not directly use any elements defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) as antisemitic. It addresses societal reactions to different scenarios—epidemics and anti-Semitic attacks—but does not employ any of the prohibited symbols, images, or language outlined in JDA's guidelines. Instead, it critiques how society responds to these situations without making specific references to Jews or their actions beyond mentioning an anti-Semitic attack. Therefore, it is not classified as antisemitic under the given definition."

Therefore, it falls outside the scope of antisemitism as per IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not directly apply any anti-Semitic tropes or symbols, nor does it use any language that would fit under the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It presents a neutral comparison between historical events affecting two different groups in their respective societies without essentializing or targeting Jews specifically beyond acknowledging their suffering.

3. **Symbolism and Stereotypes**: Using terms like ""Jews"" in a negative light, implying they are involved in political misconduct, which is a stereotypical approach criticized by the JDA.

4. **Political Criticism**: While it falls under non-antisemitic political speech if measured (C14), its use of stereotypes about Jews makes it antisemitic."

Okay, so I need to determine whether the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by understanding what the IHRA considers as antisemitism.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as a perception of Jews that may involve hatred and includes both verbal and physical manifestations directed at Jewish or non-Jewish individuals, groups, or property. It also mentions that this can be through speech, writing, actions, using negative stereotypes, or even denying the Holocaust or claiming it was invented.

Looking at the tweet in question: 

DECISION: No

The user's reasoning is to break down each part of the tweet and evaluate if any elements match antisemitic criteria. The first line says, ""You are not ‘The Jewish Community.’"" This seems neutral; it refers to someone not being considered part of a group called 'The Jewish Community.' 

Next, they mention that they represent 30% of British Jews. This is about identity percentages and doesn't inherently promote or deny any stereotypical views.

Then, the tweet states, ""You are only part of a diverse community with varying views on Labour and what constitutes antisemitism."" Here, the user is pointing out diversity in opinions regarding antisemitism itself. They're not making broad statements that could be seen as promoting hatred towards Jews or denying historical atrocities.

The next step would be to analyze each element against the IHRA criteria:

1. **Perception of Jews**: The tweet doesn't explicitly express hatred toward Jews.
2. **Rhetorical and Physical Manifestations**: It doesn't target individuals or groups by name, nor does it use harmful symbols like anti-Semitic stereotypes.
3. **Denying Historical Events**: There's no mention of denying the Holocaust or similar historical atrocities.
4. **Double Standards or Stereotypes**: The tweet talks about diversity in views but doesn’t apply any double standards to Jews.

Additionally, there’s no mention of targeting specific Jewish individuals, places, or institutions. Instead, it emphasizes diversity and inclusion without promoting any form of hatred or exclusion based on Jewish identity.

Therefore, the tweet does not fit the IHRA's definition because it doesn't engage in any of the prohibited behaviors such as promoting hatred, using negative stereotypes, denying historical facts, or targeting specific groups.
</think>

The tweet provided does not contain elements that align with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Perception and Expression**: The tweet does not express any form of hatred towards Jews. It instead emphasizes diversity within the British Jewish community, which is neutral and inclusive.

2. **Rhetorical and Physical Manifestations**: There are no statements that target individuals, groups, or institutions by name, nor do they use symbols associated with antisemitism (e.g., claims about Jews killing Jesus).

3. **Denying Historical Events**: The tweet does not reference any denial of the Holocaust or similar historical events involving Jews.

4. **Double Standards or Stereotypes**: The message focuses on diversity in views regarding Labour and antisemitism, without applying any double standards to Jews.

5. **Actions Against Targets**: There are no mentions of attacks on specific Jewish individuals, places, or institutions.

Given these points, the tweet does not exhibit characteristics that would classify it as antisemitic under the IHRA's definition. It instead promotes inclusivity and diversity within the Jewish community without promoting any form of hatred or exclusion.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the JDA. It uses phrases like ""The Jewish Community"" which, while potentially exclusionary, is balanced by acknowledging diversity within the British Jewish population.

The analysis concludes that while the tweet doesn't directly name or accuse anyone of antisemitism, its content can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reduce complex issues into broad generalizations, which may align with certain aspects of antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me start by reading the tweet carefully and then applying the guidelines from the JDA.

The tweet says: ""@EnglandYankin Actual antisemites have been trying for generations to conflate Israel and Jews so they can blame all Jews for Israel's actions. Now they have the pro-Israel crowd doing it for them. Mind = Blown.""

First, I notice that the tweet is making a claim about antisemites conflating Israel and Jews to blame Jews for Israel's actions. It also mentions that now the pro-Israel crowd is doing this conflation.

Looking at the JDA guidelines:

A. General Guidelines:
1. Essentializing or making sweeping generalizations against any population, including Jews, is antisemitic.
2. The idea that Jews are linked to evil (as in point 2 of A) is a core part of antisemitism, such as conspiracy theories about Jews controlling governments with hidden hands.

B. Israel and Palestine examples:
7. Treating Jews as agents responsible for Israel's actions.
8. Publicly condemning Israel or Zionism because someone is Jewish.
9. Assuming non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries.
10. Denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist.

Now, analyzing the tweet:

The tweet is accusing antisemites and now pro-Israel people of conflating Israel with Jews to blame them for actions. This aligns with guideline B.7, which says holding Jews responsible for Israel's conduct because they're Jewish. Similarly, point 9 talks about assuming non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries.

The tweet is using a conspiracy theory approach, suggesting that either group is doing this conflation, implying it's a systematic behavior against Jews. This fits with the idea of antisemitism as defined in the JDA, particularly points 2 and 7-9 where Jews are linked to negative actions orare blamed collectively.

Therefore, according to the guidelines, conflating Israel and Jews to blame them for actions is antisemitic because it involves treating Jews as responsible agents (point 7) and using such connotations against them.
</think>

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA. It perpetuates antisemitism by conflating Israel with Jews, blaming them collectively for Israel's actions through conspiracy theories (B.7), which aligns with antisemitic practices of assigning blame based on Jewish identity and using such connotations against Jews as a group."

The reasoning behind this decision is based on careful analysis of the tweet's content and its alignment with the principles outlined in the JDA. Here are the key points:

1. **Contextual Understanding**: The tweet refers to educated individuals involved in Auschwitz, including doctors, engineers, and architects, who selected Jews during the Holocaust. While this paints a negative stereotype about educated people, it is not explicitly tied to antisemitism but rather to a generalization about their role in historical events.

2. **Generalization Without Nuance**: The tweet simplifies the complex actions of individuals involved in the Holocaust into broad statements that essentialize them. This reduces these professionals to tools of oppression without considering the human element or the diversity within groups.

3. **Avoiding Stigma Against Jews**: The tweet does not explicitly target Jews but rather suggests a negative stereotype about educated people, which could indirectly associate them with harmful actions associated with antisemitism. However, it does not directly apply anti-Semitic definitions such as discrimination based on Jewish identity.

4. **Stereotyping and Essentialization**: By focusing on the roles of these individuals in historical events without context or nuance, the tweet employs stereotyping that is not tied to specific Jewish identities but rather to a broad category.

In conclusion, while the tweet contains harmful stereotypes about educated people, it does not directly target Jews or their heritage. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Since the tweet does not indicate that China's bans are directed at Jews, and it equates their severity without explicitly targeting them, it may not constitute antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet draws an analogy between China's travel bans and the Holocaust treatment of Jews, potentially implying that Chinese Jews are victims of persecution similar to historical events. This equates their actions without contextually differentiating them from all Jews, thereby reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish people and committing antisemitism as defined by applying historical or symbolic references to generalize against a group."

Right now, thousands of people are held captive in jails and immigrant prisons across NY. We join our Jewish and non-Jewish community in demanding: #LetMyPeopleGo. #FreeThemAll https://t.co/oqHvHP3NBg",No,"The tweet does not explicitly accuse Jews of harm through direct language or stereotypes but instead uses Passover as a moment to highlight their suffering in prisons, which could be seen as indirectly promoting awareness and support for Jewish people without overtly expressing hatred.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior. It highlights the importance of Passover as a time for celebrating Jewish freedom and includes a call to action that is inclusive, involving both Jewish and non-Jewish communities. There are no references or coded messages that target or generalize Jews negatively. Instead, it promotes solidarity and human rights advocacy, aligning with principles of equality and justice as outlined in the JDA."

It describes an event where a large group of Jews are praying, which is a positive and neutral statement. There is no mention of hatred or discrimination directed specifically at Jews, nor any elements such as stereotyping, conspiracy theories about Jews controlling institutions, or denial of historical atrocities. The tweet simply addresses the reaction to a wave of hate, without engaging in any form of antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet promotes a positive event where 90,000 Jews are gathering to pray and stand against a wave of hate. It does not involve any discrimination, hatred, or violence directed at Jews. Instead, it celebrates their collective presence and solidarity. According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their Jewishness, which is absent here. The tweet supports unity and collective action without promoting any form of anti-Semitic stereotypes, caricatures, or harmful generalizations about Jews as a group."

This story depicts a sage who indulges in promiscuous behavior while another sage accepts it as a lesson from Torah, contributing to the perception of Jews in negative ways. According to the IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves any form of hatred or discrimination directed at Jews based on their identity. While the tweet does not explicitly promote hatred, its context and reliance on this stereotype could perpetuate antisemitic perceptions, thus qualifying as antisemitic under the IHRA's framework.",No,"The tweet references a historical anecdote about sages learning from each other's actions, which could be interpreted as associating Jewish people with negative traits. While the context is within Jewish history and tradition, it implies a link between Jews and such behavior, potentially essentializing them based on their past actions. This aligns with JDA guidelines that prohibit linking an entire group with negative characteristics without justification."

1. **Derogatory Language**: The tweet uses terms like ""infidel,"" which is a broad and derogatory term referring to non-Religious Muslims, a subset of Jews (Jews). By calling infidels below Jews and pigs, it directly attacks and dehumanizes Jewish individuals.

2. **Negative Stereotypes**: The tweet refers to covering women in black as part of what's considered ""Jewish."" This perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jewish culture and appearance.

3. **Rape Stigma**: The claim that rape isn't considered rape if the victim is non-Muslim (i.e., a non-Jew) reinforces a negative stereotype about Jews, associating them with such stigma.

4. **Use of Pejorative Terms**: Phrases like ""they mean forbidden within their religion"" and ""#bastards"" further demean Jewish individuals by associating them with negativity from other religions and using offensive language.

These elements collectively constitute antisemitism as defined by the IHRA, as they involve discriminatory language and stigmatization directed toward Jewish individuals.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or denounce the Jewish people but instead refers to non-Muslims in general terms such as ""infidels."" It uses strong language like ""below Jews and pigs"" which could be interpreted as stigmatizing a broader category that includes Jews. However, it doesn't specifically address or comment on aspects of Jewish identity such as equality or discrimination against them. Therefore, while the tweet may carry negative connotations, it does not directly target Jews within the context provided by the JDA guidelines.

The analysis concludes that the tweet is not explicitly antisemitic based on the specific guidelines provided, but its content could be open to interpretation regarding antisemitism depending on how it's viewed in broader contexts."

It portrays an event of historical kindness and celebrates it without any negative connotations towards Jewish people. There is no discrimination, prejudice, or hostile act directed specifically at them. Instead, it honors a heroic action and supports Holocaust Remembrance Day, which aims to educate and prevent such issues rather than stigmatize any group.

It calls for the murder of Jews (hatred), uses conspiracy theories targeting Jews (""Jew Coup""), and references antisemitic ideology associated with ""white nationalism."" These actions and language align with antisemitic behavior, including harmful speech and perception directed toward Jewish individuals or groups.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition because it employs coded language and conspiracy theories to associate Donald Trump Jr., a Republican figure, with antisemitic traits. By referring to him as a ""Jew"" during an impeachment context and associating this with a ""Jew Coup,"" it uses coded speech (guideline 2) to imply Jews are behind political conspiracies. Additionally, linking antisemitism to white nationalism (as in the tag ""JewsAgainstWhiteNationalism"") reinforces harmful stereotypes about Jews (guideline 10). These actions constitute discrimination and violate JDA's definition of antisemitism.

The tweet uses coded language typical of antisemitic rhetoric, aligning with guidelines that emphasize the use of symbols, images, and negative stereotypes to target Jewish identities. It also spreads conspiracy theories and reinforces harmful narratives about Jews supporting white nationalist ideologies, which is problematic under the JDA's framework. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic."

By referring to ""fascists"" without specific context, it risks perpetuating negative stereotypes, especially since Netanyahu is a prominent Jewish leader. The use of such language can be seen as facilitating antisemitism by associating certain behaviors or identities with anti-Semitic stereotypes, thereby contributing to the perception and discrimination against Jews. This aligns with the IHRA's definition, particularly regarding the use of negative stereotypes and indirect references that perpetuate hatred toward Jews.",No,"The tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines. While it contains derogatory language directed at Netanyahu and associates him with fascism, the criticism is not based on any evidence of anti-Semitic prejudice or discrimination. The tweet does not generalize about all Jews or make unfounded claims that could be interpreted as denying Jewish equality or personhood. Instead, it focuses on an individual without providing a basis for the negative characterization, thus avoiding antisemitic practices."

While it doesn't explicitly hate Jews, the language may be misinterpreted or used to spread harmful stereotypes, aligning with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as involving hateful perceptions directed at Jews.",No,"The tweet in question employs essentialization by categorically labeling some Jews as ""parasites"" while also stereotyping all Jews based on this trait. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines, particularly point 1, which prohibits essentializing or making broad negative generalizations about a population. Additionally, using Einstein as an example of a positive contribution by a Jew to challenge the stereotype further escalates antisemitism by reducing an entire group to a negative stereotype without providing evidence or nuance. The tweet also fails to provide a balanced view and instead dismisses non-Jewish individuals while reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jews, thus violating JDA's definition of antisemitism.

The analysis concludes that the tweet is antisemitic based on its use of harmful stereotypes and essentialization of Jewish people."
