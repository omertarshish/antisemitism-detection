Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is considered antisemitic according to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition. Let me start by understanding what antisemitism means in IHRA's terms.

From the working definition provided, antisemitism involves a perception of Jews that can manifest as hatred or discrimination towards Jewish individuals, groups, or their property. It also includes expressing this hatred through speech, writing, actions, and using negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews.

Now looking at the tweet: ""@chloetsila not cool. many Jews reclaimed what their ancestors were forced to wear and now wear our symbol with pride. Non Jews have no business wearing it if you ask me""

First, I notice that the user is referring to ""Jews"" in a negative way by calling them ""not cool."" That's a direct attack on the group as a whole. Then they mention that many Jews reclaimed symbols their ancestors were forced to wear, implying that non-Jews shouldn't wear it either.

Breaking this down, the tweet contains several elements:

1. **Negative stereotype**: The user refers to Jews in a derogatory way (""not cool"") and suggests that non-Jews shouldn't wear the symbol they've reclaiming.
2. **Stereotyping**: They imply that only Jews have a right to wear certain symbols, which could be seen as excluding or demeaning non-Jews.
3. **Judgmental language**: The phrase ""Non Jews have no business wearing it if you ask me"" is judgmental and could reinforce the idea of culturalappropriation, which can be considered antisemitic.

Considering IHRA's definition, these elements align with antisemitism because they involve a negative perception of Jews (or Jewishness) leading to discrimination against them or others based on their Jewish heritage. The tweet doesn't shy away from making broad generalizations and uses language that could marginalize non-Jews by associating them with negative actions related to Jews.

Additionally, the use of symbols like the swastika is often a classic example in antisemitism, even if it's being used here in a derogatory context. The tweet is also making an assertion about cultural rights and appropriateness, which can be part of broader antisemitic ideologies that justify discrimination based on ethnicity or religion.

Therefore, taking all these points into account, the tweet does fit within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it contains elements that align with the criteria for antisemitism. Specifically:

1. **Negative Stereotypes and prejudices**: The tweet uses derogatory language (""not cool"") towards Jews, which perpetuates a negative stereotype.
2. **Stereotyping**: By implying that only Jews have the right to wear certain symbols, the tweet discriminates against non-Jews based on their Jewish heritage.
3. **Judgmental and discriminatory language**: The statement ""Non Jews have no business wearing it if you ask me"" reflects exclusionary attitudes towards non-Jews associated with Jewish practices or symbols.

These actions perpetuate antisemitism by reinforcing negative perceptions of Jews, leading to discrimination against them and others based on their identity.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It uses words to critique what it perceives as exclusively Jewish cultural practices, such as reclaiming symbols, but does not engage in systematic discrimination or stigmatization against Jews. Instead, it seems to reflect a general critique of certain cultural behaviors without targeting Jews specifically, thus avoiding antisemitic content."
1320133624805601281,Parrotvill24,2020-10-24 22:42:37+00:00,0,Jews,"@nanwhaley You really are Anti-Christian aren't you? You will make up anything you can to prevent a Christian from being there. Would it matter if she were Muslim? They too are very conservative (except Omar, she just hates Christians and Jews) are you like her???",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). Antisemitism is defined as a perception or expression of hatred toward Jews, either directly or through their community institutions and properties. It also involves using negative stereotypes, misleading accusations, or explicit hostility towards Jewish people.

The tweet in question attacks someone for being anti-Christian and generalizes about excluding non-Christians without specifically targeting Jews or singling them out. While it may exclude Muslims as a broader category, there is no specific reference to Jews, nor does it use any negative stereotypes or accusatory language specific to the Jewish community. The tweet seems to be more about exclusion based on religion in general rather than antisemitic behavior.

Therefore, this tweet does not fit within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism because it does not involve targeting Jews, using negative stereotypes against them, or making any antisemitic claims specific to their community.",Yes,"The tweet contains multiple instances of antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentialization**: The use of terms like ""anti-Christian"" and stereotyping Muslims as conservative (except Omar) essentializes and generalizes about groups, aligning with JDA's first guideline.

2. **Linkage to Evil**: By suggesting Jews control governments, banks, media, etc., the tweet mirrors the classic antisemitic stereotype that Jews are linked to evil, which is explicitly addressed in JDA guideline 2.

3. **Coded Language and Stereotypes**: The mention of Muslims being conservative and attacking specific groups (Christians and Jews) uses coded language typical of antisemitism, as outlined in JDA's guidelines.

4. **Essentializing Racial Groups**: The self-deprecating comment personalizes towards a person of color, furthering racial discrimination.

Thus, the tweet exhibits clear violations of antisemitic principles as defined by the JDA."

Additionally, by implying that addressing issues about Jewish peoplehood is not taken seriously, it engages with the notion of discrimination and moral judgment towards a group, thus aligning with antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or refer to specific antisemitic acts involving Jews. Instead, it is a general critique directed at a person (AlexBkane) about singling out Jews for negative treatment without providing concrete examples of such behavior. According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as a people, but this tweet does not involve any specific antisemitic actions or references; it merely criticizes someone else's approach in a general sense."

This equates Palestinian involvement in Black Lives Matter with antisemitic behavior, thereby generalizing against all Jews and contributing to antisemitism under the IHRA's definition.

Okay, so I need to determine if the tweet provided is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: ""@RuslanSmith1 @Thom4s_Dank @c0g1018 @FayeH321 @BenMFreeman @jeremycorbyn It's the white European colonialist Zionist jews who had no presence there in the preceding thousands of years that cause the problems in Palestine. Pretending white Europeans have any link to the middle East at all is an anti Palestinian trope. Palestinians are also all semites.""

First, I'll break down what the tweet is saying. The user is addressing several people and making two main arguments:

1. They claim that ""white European colonialist Zionists"" were never present in the Middle East for thousands of years, which they say caused problems in Palestine.
2. They accuse others of falsely claiming a link between white Europeans and the Middle East, calling this an anti-Palestinian trope.
3. Finally, they state that Palestinians are all semites.

I need to apply the JDA guidelines to each part.

Looking at the definition: antisemitism is discrimination against Jews. The guidelines emphasize essentializing, making broad generalizations about a population, and linking Jews with evil forces like the Nazis in history.

Now, let's analyze the tweet step by step.

First statement: ""white European colonialist Zionist jews who had no presence there... that cause the problems in Palestine.""

- The term ""jews"" here refers to Jewish people. But is it being essentialized or making a broad generalization? The user seems to be saying that the absence of white Europeans (Jews) caused Palestinian issues, which implies that their group's absence is directly responsible for these issues.

However, in reality, historical context matters. Many cultures and groups have had significant presence in the Middle East over thousands of years, but it doesn't mean they're solely responsible for current issues. The link between past presence and present problems isn't straightforward because other factors like politics, economics, and social dynamics play roles.

Next statement: ""Pretending white Europeans have any link to the middle East at all is an anti Palestinian trope.""

- Here, the user is accusing others of falsely claiming a historical connection between white Europeans and the Middle East. This might be problematic if it's based on false or misleading information. However, the issue arises if it's used as a stereotype or generalization.

The last part: ""Palstinians are also all semites.""

- This seems to suggest that all Palestinians are Jewish (semites). In reality, there's a distinction between Jews and Palestinians; not all Palestinians identify as Jews. This is problematic because it misrepresents the diversity within the Palestinian population, reducing them to a single identity based on heritage rather than individual identities.

Applying JDA guidelines:

1. The tweet uses ""jews"" but doesn't essentialize into a broader category beyond that group. However, the first part implies a cause-and-effect between absence and problems without evidence.
2. The accusation of linking white Europeans to the Middle East is a broad statement, potentially harmful if taken as a generalization or stereotype.
3. The claim that all Palestinians are semites reduces their complexity and misrepresents identities.

Now, considering the guidelines:

- Essentializing: Using ""jews"" without context might be seen as essentializing, but it's about the group rather than an inherent trait. However, pairing this with a statement linking absence to current issues could imply broader judgments.
- Coded language: The accusation of a link is coded and could be used to stigmatize or generalize.
- Reducing diversity: Claiming all Palestinians are semites simplifies their identities.

Therefore, the tweet contains elements that align with antisemitism by using broad generalizations, coded language, and reducing diversity. It's important to address these issues without evidence-based claims but rather to promote understanding of the complex history and identities involved.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA because it employs essentialization, coded language, and reduces diversity. Here's the detailed explanation:

1. **Essentialization**: The use of ""jews"" without context could be seen as essentializing, though not exclusively. However, pairing this with a cause-and-effect statement linking absence to current issues may imply broader judgments.
2. **Coded Language**: Accusing others of falsely claiming historical connections introduces coded language, which can stigmatize or generalize about the Middle East's historical links.
3. **Reduction of Diversity**: The claim that all Palestinians are semites simplifies their identities and reduces their diversity into a single category based on heritage.

These elements together align with antisemitic traits as defined by the JDA."

This is a form of stereotype association, which according to the IHRA definition, constitutes antisemitism as it reduces an individual to negative characteristics associated with a group (Jews) without justification. Additionally, this type of labeling can contribute to discrimination and denies opportunities to Jewish individuals, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitic acts.",Yes,"1. **Concentration Camps and Holocaust Reference**: The tweet implies that the Republican leader's belief in concentration camps aligns with historical antisemitic associations, such as the Holocaust. This reference is problematic under JDA guideline 5, which criticizes denying or minimizing the Holocaust.

2. **Coded Language**: Using ""MAGA Jews"" is a derogatory term and constitutes coded language that associates political views with an ethnic group without justification. This aligns with JDA guideline 10, which addresses collectively associating non-Israeli Jews with Israel in negative ways.

3. **Applying Negative Stereotypes**: The tweet directs criticism at ""MAGA Jews"" based on their ethnicity, using a term that inherently carries antisemitic connotations. This is akin to applying classical antisemitic stereotypes as described in JDA guideline 6 and 7.

4. **Hostile and discriminatory Tone**: The overall tone of the tweet is confrontational and discriminatory, aiming to label groups negatively without evidence or justification, which fits with the spirit of JDA's definition of antisemitism.

In summary, the tweet employs several JDA guidelines by referencing Holocaust imagery, using coded language, associating views with Jews, and maintaining a hostile tone, all contributing to its antisemitic nature."

The tweet uses a term that could carry connotations implying a negative stereotype about Jews in Europe, potentially targeting individuals within that community without explicit identification. This form of referencing groups based on Jewish identity is consistent with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly regarding the use of negative stereotypes and exclusionary language toward Jews as a group.

Okay, so I need to determine if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. It says, ""@MairavZ Ah, and Jews control the world....Nazis were right.\n\nStop sounding like a Nazi. They murdered my family & yours. Browning up to them, will not make them like us more."" 

I notice two main points here: the first part mentions that Jews control the world, comparing Nazis' actions, and then there's a request to stop sounding like a Nazi.

Looking at the JDA definition, antisemitism is discrimination or prejudice against Jews. The guidelines mention several points related to this. Point 5 says denying or minimizing the Holocaust by dismissing its reality is antisemitic. Also, Point 4 talks about coded speech and how some statements can be antisemitic even if not overtly racial.

In the first part of the tweet, ""Jews control the world....Nazis were right"" seems to link Jews with the Nazis, implying that Nazis are correct in their actions against Jews. This could be problematic because it associates a known group responsible for atrocities (Nazis) with Jews, which might be seen as stigmatizing or promoting anti-Semitic views.

The second part, ""Stop sounding like a Nazi,"" is a direct reference to Nazis and implies copying their behavior. This part could be considered antisemitic because it endorses the behavior attributed to Nazis by equating them with Jews controlling the world, thereby reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews.

Looking at the JDA guidelines, point 6 says applying symbols or images of classical antisemitism (like Nazi imagery) to Israel can be antisemitic. Even though the tweet isn't directly targeting Israel but using a Nazi symbol metaphorically, it still aligns with point 6 by using Nazi-like language against Jews.

Point 14 mentions that political speech doesn't have to be tempered to be protected under human rights. However, the problematic aspect here is more about the content than the form of expression.

So combining these points, the tweet uses antisemitic language by equating Jews with Nazis and advocating a negative stereotype towards them.
</think>

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition because it employs antisemitic language that links Jews to the Nazis, promoting a harmful stereotype. By stating ""Jews control the world...Nazis were right"" and urging others to ""Stop sounding like a Nazi,"" the tweet associates Jews with an antagonist group known for atrocities, thereby contributing to anti-Semitic bias."

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** The tweet must align with IHRA's definition, which involves hatred, stereotyping, or blaming Jews collectively based on negative perceptions.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet Content:** The tweet focuses on categorizing a group (without Jews) and their speech about Jews without targeting them personally or using negative stereotypes.

3. **Identifying Possible Issues:** There are no references to hate speech, conspiracy theories, or exclusionary discrimination towards Jews.

4. **Conclusion:** Since there's no direct or indirect antisemitic content, the tweet is not classified as antisemitic under IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet is reacting to a statement made by a group, specifically dismissing the presence of white nationalists and neo-Nazis. It does not engage in any form of discrimination or prejudice directed at Jews based on their ethnicity. Instead, it critiques the content of the group's speech without making any statements about the treatment or characteristics of Jews themselves. Therefore, it falls under examples that are not antisemitic as outlined in section C.B.13 of the JDA."

It employs a historical comparison linking Trump's predecessor, the Nazis, to the persecution of Jews during WWII. This association uses negative stereotypes and demonizes Jews based on their historical context, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes perpetuating harmful stereotypes or justifications rooted in anti-Semitic ideologies. The tweet's purpose may stretch into associating a current figure with past negative actions against Jews, thereby contributing to antisemitic narratives.",Yes,"The tweet uses antisemitic language by equating Donald Trump with the Nazis, who are associated with purging Jews. This comparison falls under JDA's definition as it treats Jews (as a group) in a negative and discriminatory manner, aligning with guideline 2 which links Jews to forces of evil. Additionally, it incorporates coded speech (guideline 3), where Trump is portrayed as inherently hostile or discriminative against Jews based on their ethnicity.

The tweet associates Trump's perceived actions with historical anti-Semitic events, contributing to antisemitism by essentializing Jews and treating them as a collective target. This form of speech is not only harmful but also violates JDA's guidelines regarding the essence of antisemitism and the use of coded language to stigmatize Jewish people.

Okay, so I need to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition provided. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the tweet itself:
""""No Zionists allowed

It is back to the days of 'no dogs or Jews'.

We are hearing this messaging frequently - in hard-left spaces - such as in unions, at demos and on campus.

This anti-Jewish racism must be faced down and sent back to the toxic sewers where it belongs.""

Alright, so the tweet starts by mentioning ""No Zionists allowed,"" which immediately catches my attention. The term ""Zionist"" is often used to describe people who support Israel or have some connection to Jewish nationalism. Historically, this has been a problematic label because it's tied to antisemitism.

Next, the tweet says, ""It is back to the days of 'no dogs or Jews'."" This seems like a reference to exclusionary rhetoric where both dogs and Jews are targeted. In antisemitic contexts, such as in some far-left groups, people might claim that Jews are behind certain negative events by making broad generalizations.

The tweet continues by stating that this messaging is common in ""hard-left spaces,"" including unions, demos, and campuses. This indicates a widespread issue beyond just isolated incidents. The author associates these actions with ""anti-Jewish racism"" and urges them to be addressed in the context of ""toxic sewers.""

Now, applying the IHRA definition: Antisemitism is defined as a perception directed at Jews, expressed through hatred, either literally or metaphorically, towards individuals or groups. It can manifest in speech, writing, visual forms, and actions, using negative stereotypes.

Looking at the tweet's content:
1. The use of ""No Zionists allowed"" suggests exclusionary policies targeting Jewish communities.
2. The mention of ""no dogs or Jews"" is a stereotypical binary that dehumanizes Jews alongside another group (dogs), promoting harmful dichotomies often used in antisemitism.
3. Referencing places like unions, demos, and campuses indicates systemic discrimination within various institutions and settings.

Furthermore, the tweet employs a form of antisemitic rhetoric by associating Jewish people with negative connotations (like dogs) to justify exclusionary behavior against them. This ties into the IHRA's definition as it uses dehumanizing stereotypes and associates Jews with negative traits or actions, leading to discrimination.

Additionally, the context in which this tweet is shared—unions, demos, campuses—is part of a broader trend where antisemitism is used to demean Jewish communities. The call to ""facedown"" suggests an attempt to isolate and suppress them further, aligning with antisemitic tactics.

However, I need to consider if all elements are explicitly covered by the IHRA definition or if there's any nuance missing. For instance, does this tweet explicitly deny or harm the actual rights of Jews? It doesn't directly accuse Jews of wrongdoing but rather uses exclusionary labels and stigmatization, which is still antisemitic.

Also, while the tweet uses harmful metaphors (dogs), it's part of a broader context where such language is used to demean Jewish people. The IHRA considers such instances as antisemitic if they stem from a hatred or perception directed at Jews.

Therefore, putting it all together: The tweet employs exclusionary language targeting Jewish groups within professional and public spaces, using stereotypes that associate them with negativity (doubts). This aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism because it involves hate speech, stereotyping, and discrimination directed at Jews in various forms—metaphorical, systemic, and exclamatory.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. 

Explanation:
- The tweet uses exclusionary language (""No Zionists allowed"") that targets Jewish groups within professional (unions), public spaces (demos, campuses), and online platforms.
- It employs stereotypical references (e.g., ""no dogs or Jews"") that dehumanize and associate negative connotations with Jewish people.
- The context of these remarks is systemic, found in far-left spaces, which aligns with antisemitism as it involves exclusionary and discriminatory tactics.
- The use of labels like ""Zionist"" and the call to address anti-Jewish racism are indicative of broader antisemitic tropes.

These elements together meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet employs several elements that align with the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses the slur ""Zionists"" to exclude Jews, referencing exclusionary messages common in hard-left spaces. These messages are consistent with antisemitic tropes of targeting Jews as a group based on their identity. Additionally, the tweet calls out anti-Jewish racism and suggests it should be addressed elsewhere, reinforcing its antisemitic nature. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet exhibits anti-Semitic content by promoting exclusionary rhetoric directed at Jewish people."

However, it frames this event as ""evil,"" reducing Jewish victims to mere victims without acknowledging their humanity or contributions.

Essentializing Jews by linking them solely to atrocities and not considering their broader societal roles aligns with the JDA's guidelines against antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic as it promotes stereotypes and simplification of historical facts."
