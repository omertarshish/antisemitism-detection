She arrived at #Auschwitz on 6 October 1944 in a transport of 1,500 Jews. She was murdered in a gas chamber. https://t.co/O15ev4xfNv",No,"The tweet in question describes a specific event involving Carla Bromet, a Dutch Jewish girl, and her fate during the Holocaust. However, according to the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which focuses on directed hatred or discrimination toward Jews as a group or their communities, this tweet does not meet the criteria. It does not exhibit any behaviors such as stereotyping, demonizing, or falsely accusing an entire group. The tweet is accurate in its factual description and does not perpetuate any form of antisemitism.

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet does not directly reference or support policies against Israel or mention antisemitic stereotypes about Israelis or Jews. However, it essentializes Carla Bromet as a ""Jewish girl,"" reducing her to her ethnicity without context, which aligns with the JDA's guidelines against essentializing populations based solely on descent. While discussing historical events involving Jewish people is problematic when framed in a way that could reinforce negative stereotypes, this tweet does not explicitly advocate for harm against Jews or use harmful imagery, making it not antisemitic under the given definition."

It uses stereotypical language about Orthodox Jews and Arab women, labeling them as ""goyim,"" which is a negative stereotype targeting Jews. Additionally, it associates an Arab woman with ""goyim,"" implying a connection to non-Jews. The mention of Israel could be interpreted as part of the narrative, although not directly, contributing to the overall message that may falsely blame Jews for broader issues or actions. These elements together meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits several elements that align with the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs stereotyping by associating Arab women with Jews in a negative context, which is a common tactic in antisemitic rhetoric. Additionally, it references the State of Israel in a problematic manner, suggesting criticism without evidence and potentially implying loyalty issues among Jews based on their identity. These actions are consistent with JDA guidelines that define antisemitism as discrimination against Jews or their institutions."

This action may perpetuate a negative stereotype against Jewish people, fitting within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using stereotypes or labels to target Jews. The tweet could be seen as engaging in antisemitic rhetoric by associating and labeling Jewish individuals without justification, thus qualifying as antisemitic according to the provided criteria.",Yes,"The tweet employs a metaphor that substitutes ""jews"" for ""boys,"" potentially implying that Jews should replace them. This substitution uses negative stereotypes and equates a group (boys) with Jews in a way that could perpetuate discrimination or exclusion, aligning with the definition of antisemitism as harmful associations based on Jewish identity."

These people are the biggest threat to us and to SO many other marginalized groups.",Yes,"The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It associates specific symbols often linked to antisemitism, such as nazi flags and Auschwitz imagery, with threats towards a perceived group within the Jewish community (BIPOC). This targeting based on ethnic or religious characteristics aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes expressing hatred or discrimination against Jews based on their perceived characteristics. The tweet uses these symbols to generalize and target a subgroup of the Jewish population, thereby qualifying as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it uses the Nazi flag and ""camp auschwitz"" clothing as symbols representing Jews or BIPOC groups. This association is a problematic stereotype that reifies negative images of Jews, aligning with JDA's definition of antisemitism through essentialization and use of harmful symbols linked to evil forces."

It also uses ""J st"" instead of ""Jews,"" further perpetuating stigmatization. Additionally, the call to defend Israel aligns with antisemitic narratives that equate Israeli actions with responsibility for harm to Jewish people. These elements together meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism by involving harmful stereotypes and broad generalizations about Jews or related groups.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses several key elements from the JDA's guidelines. First, the tweet employs a form of racial essentialization by labeling ""Jew hater"" as someone who hates Jews, which is an example of treating a population based on its assumed characteristics without evidence. Second, it connects the act of hating Jews to being the worst, thereby associating Jews with negative stereotypes, which aligns with the JDA's point 2 about linking a group (Jews) to evil or forces of hatred. Third, the statement ""J st must me destroyed"" is a harmful generalization that could be seen as discriminatory and offensive, fitting guideline 3 regarding antisemitic words leading to harm. Additionally, guideline 10 is invoked when it suggests destroying all Jews entirely, which is a form of denial of their right to exist and flourish in Israel. The use of ""long live Israel"" may imply support for Israeli actions but does not negate the antisemitic elements present in the rest of the tweet. Overall, multiple guidelines from the JDA are satisfied here, making the tweet clearly antisemitic."

The statement ""we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles"" contains judgmental and potentially discriminatory remarks targeting Jews without substantial evidence or context. This aligns with JDA guideline 2, which warns against essentializing groups and labeling them as inherently evil through harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories. Additionally, the use of coded language such as ""stumbling block"" towards Jews is a common tactic in antisemitism. Therefore, while the tweet's intentions may be benign, its phrasing and potential implications could be interpreted as contributing to antisemitic ideas."

The one that hated Jews?\n\nhttps://t.co/aanSbEDnP3,Yes,"The tweet in question uses the name ""Luther"" to call someone out for hating Jews, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. This type of statement is considered antisemitic as it involves expressing hatred toward Jewish people or communities. Without additional context about the nature of ""Luther,"" assuming this tweet intends to accuse him of hating Jews makes it fall under the category of antisemitic speech defined by the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet employs a negative stereotype by associating a specific individual (referred to as ""The one that hated Jews"") with a negative trait (hating Jews). This constitutes an essentialization of the entire Jewish group, aligning with JDA's definition. Essentializing or using stereotypes to generalize about a population is inherently antisemitic as it denies human diversity and perpetuates prejudice against a specific group.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Essentialization:** The tweet labels a person associated with hating Jews, which generalizes the entire Jewish population.
2. **Negative Stereotypes:** Using ""hated"" is a negative trait linked to Jews, fitting the definition of antisemitism that manipulates stereotypes.
3. **Guideline 2:** The link between Jews and evil (or negative traits) aligns with JDA's guidelines on antisemitic associations.

Thus, the tweet is antisemitic by employing essentialization and negative stereotypes about Jews."

Antisemitism involves a specific perception of hatred directed at Jews, which includes speech, writing, visual forms, and actions that exhibit negative stereotypes or references to Jews. The tweet contains two distinct scenarios:

1. **First Scenario**: It suggests that Jesus literally meant something about Jews based on a metaphorical reference (""Jesus literally meant what he said""). However, there is no historical evidence that Jesus made any statements directly targeting Jews. Therefore, this part lacks specificity and context to be considered antisemitic.

2. **Second Scenario**: This part involves a story about the Last Supper without any mention of Jews or any reference to them. It does not exhibit any form of antisemitism as it is unrelated to Jewish people or communities.

Since neither scenario explicitly targets Jews, refers to specific historical genocides like the Holocaust, employs harmful stereotypes, nor uses rhetoric that demonizes Jews, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Context of Discussion**: The tweet mentions ""Jews"" in a humorous context without any indication of broader antisemitic ideologies or coded messages. It contrasts two situations, one involving a religious reference and another a modern story-telling scenario.

2. **Applicability of Guidelines**:
   - **Guideline 1 (General)**: The content does not essentialize or generalize about Jews.
   - **Guidelines 6-15**: There are no references to antisemitic symbols, stereotypes, or practices such as racializing Israel or supporting policies that denies Jews' rights. The statements do not align with any JDA examples of antisemitism.

3. **Humor and Context**: The humor in the tweet suggests a light-hearted exchange without serious content related to antisemitism. There's no suggestion of intent or deeper messages that would fall under antisemitic criteria.

Thus, based on the JDA guidelines, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic."

It discriminates against non-Jewish individuals by singling them out for retweeting and spreading content that prioritizes Jewish discussions over others' perspectives. This targeting based on identity, specifically Jewishness, aligns with IHRA's criteria of antisemitism, which includes directing actions or attention towards a specific group (Jews) while excluding others from participating in the conversation.",No,"The tweet employs exclusionary language by directing attention solely to Jews without acknowledging the importance of discussing the issue among non-Jews.

Instead, it appears to be a political statement about pandemic measures without explicitly invoking antisemitism or targeting Jewish individuals or groups.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration.

While Tom Emmer refers to ""rich Jews"" and associates them with Democratic political success in Congress, this statement does not explicitly or inclusively generalize about all Jews. It does not employ the JDA's guidelines for antisemitism, such as essentializing a group, linking them to evil through conspiracy theories, or using negative stereotypes without addressing the broader implications of anti-Semitism.

The analysis of the JDA guidelines reveals that this statement is neither discriminatory nor coded speech.

The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as it does not consistently apply negative stereotypes or associate Jews with a specific harmful act in a way that would be considered antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.

The IHRA considers antisemitism when there is a systematic perception of Jews that includes hatred, racial discrimination, or other forms of prejudice based on Jewish identity.

It critiques how discussions about Novara ignore Jewish contributions but doesn't accuse Jews of any conspiracies, harm, or discrimination. Therefore, it doesn't meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews negatively but uses a metaphor involving Novara's contributions to its economy. By suggesting that people forget how Jews contribute there, it implies a negative stereotype about Jews' role in Novara, which aligns with antisemitic ideas of using stereotypes to dismiss or devalue a group.

The tweet is not directly antisemitic because it does not explicitly accuse Jews of being evil or use anti-Semitic symbols. However, the implied criticism could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes, potentially affecting perceptions without direct language targeting Jews. Therefore, while not explicitly so, it may contribute to antisemitism by associating a group with negative connotations.

But upon closer examination, using Novara's context and suggesting that people forget how Jews contribute might not constitute a direct attack on Jewishness or use stereotypical language. It seems more like a critique of how people view Novara rather than targeting Jews specifically.

Thus, the tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA because it does not meet the criteria for using negative stereotypes or essentializing a group based on their association with a context (Novara) that is neutral and unrelated to Jewish identity. The tweet seems more like a general critique of how people perceive Novara rather than targeting Jews in an anti-Semitic manner.

Final decision: No, because it does not use negative stereotypes or language tied to Jewish identity but instead critiques perceptions without explicitly targeting the group."

By associating these atrocities with a call to oppose vaccination, it uses historical events to justify a moral stance against a public health measure. This aligns with antisemitic practices as defined by IHRA, particularly through the use of negative stereotypes (Jews) associated with atrocities and employing such history to denominate a broader societal issue, thereby contributing to antisemitism.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, or hostility directed at Jews as a group. While the tweet references historical facts about the Holocaust involving Jews and uses symbols associated with them, its primary focus is on criticizing vaccination policies rather than directly targeting Jews. The guidelines emphasize that applying such symbols or referencing historical contexts involving Jews against Israel can be considered antisemitic (B.6). However, in this case, the tweet's main argument shifts to a broader critique of vaccine policies and does not directly engage with antisemitic tropes related to Jews. Instead, it uses Holocaust-related imagery metaphorically, which might blur the line between legitimate criticism and antisemitism. Therefore, while there are elements that could be misconstrued as antisemitic, the tweet's intent is more about health policy rather than overtly targeting Jews, so it does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic according to the JDA."

While this could be seen as a legitimate reference to historical atrocities, it oversimplifies the complexities of the Holocaust and may perpetuate harmful stereotypes. By using the term #Antisemitism, it implies that all Jews are responsible for their own suffering, which aligns with antisemitic principles. Additionally, the tweet's focus on a specific Jewish community within a broader discussion could contribute to antisemitic categorization according to the IHRA definition.

The tweet acknowledges the murder of Jews in the Netherlands but uses this as a point to criticize antisemitism more broadly, potentially trivializing the atrocities and reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes attacking specific Jewish groups or using historical facts to stigmatize them. 

In summary, the tweet is considered antisemitic because it attacks a specific Jewish community (those in the Netherlands) by referencing their persecution and uses this to criticize the broader concept of antisemitism, thereby contributing to antisemitic sentiment as defined by the IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

Therefore, it does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet includes the term ""Anti-Semitism"" in its reference section. While the product itself (a book by Kevin J. Anderson) may not inherently contain harmful content, the inclusion of ""Anti-Semitism"" alongside mentions of Holocaust and Jews could imply promotion or advocacy for anti-Semitic ideologies without providing factual context that would negate such intent. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is antisemitic as it refers to a theme that could be used to promote or support anti-Semitic views."

It does not contain any language that exhibits hatred, discrimination, or stigmatization towards Jews. Instead, it accurately describes a historical event involving a Dutch Jew without making any antisemitic associations or cancellations.

This comparison perpetuates negative stereotypes, demonizing a group (Jews) and associating them with historical persecution. Additionally, it uses offensive language to place all responsibility for India's problems on Jews, engaging in scapegoating. These actions align with antisemitic behaviors as defined by IHRA, which includes using negative character traits or harmful stereotypes to target Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet employs a negative stereotype by referring to Nirav Modi as a ""Jew,"" which is a common anti-Semitic practice. This aligns with the JDA's definition, particularly guidelines 2 (linking Jews to evil) and 3 (use of coded or negative stereotypes).

It is a commentary on purchasing behavior without targeting specific Jews or Jewish institutions. There are no elements of hatred, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories related to-Semitism present in the tweet.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as involving hateful perceptions directed at Jewish individuals or groups. Since this tweet does not mention any Jews specifically and avoids any negative references to Jewish communities or practices, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet employs stereotyping by lumping all Jews into a negative category with the phrase ""Us Jews."" It generalizes their frugality in an uncontextualized manner, which is problematic as it essentializes a group. Additionally, referencing conspiracy theories about weather manipulation machines could imply broader antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy thinking, aligning with JDA guidelines that warn against such practices.

The tweet uses words to stereotype Jews without basis, fitting the definition of antisemitism as discrimination based on race or ethnicity. The use of ""weather manipulation machine"" adds an element of conspiracy theory, further reinforcing negative stereotypes typical of antisemitic tropes. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA.
