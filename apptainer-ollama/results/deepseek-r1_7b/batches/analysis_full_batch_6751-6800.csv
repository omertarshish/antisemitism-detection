Upon closer examination, there appears to be a typo or unclear wording (""kikes"" and ""VMS""), which might suggest an intention to criticize someone else rather than targeting Jews. The IHRA definition of antisemitism involves directed hatred toward Jews, expressed through speech, writing, etc., often involving negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews. However, this tweet does not explicitly target Jewish people or use language that aligns with the stereotypical or conspiratorial anti-Semitic rhetoric. It seems to be more of a personal critique of someone else, possibly part of a viral meme or trend, without any indication of antisemitic content. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not contain any discriminatory language or references targeting Jews. It is a general statement about Aditi Rathore and her work without any negative connotations towards the Jewish community. Therefore, it complies with JDA guidelines by avoiding antisemitic behaviors."

The use of ""go nuts"" further escalates the rhetoric, aligning with antisemitic language that denigrates Jewish peoplehood. Additionally, the reference to Gabbard, a figure known for anti-Semitic remarks, contextualizes the tweet within an antisemitic framework. According to the JDA guidelines, particularly those regarding the use of symbols and stereotypes (guidelines 6-14), this tweet qualifies as antisemitic because it employs coded language and harsh rhetoric directed at Jews without providing any evidence or context that justifies such treatment."

This expression of affection towards a group perceived as Jews falls under antisemitism, as it involves using negative stereotypes and expressing hatred toward a specific ethnic group.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Key Phrase:** The tweet includes ""i love kikes."" The term ""kikes"" is analyzed here.
2. **Understand the Context of ""Kikes"":** In this context, ""kikes"" refers to Jewish people, as it is a derogatory or pejorative term used to denote them.
3. **Apply IHRA Definition:** The IHRA defines antisemitism as hatred toward Jews, which can be expressed through speech using negative stereotypes.
4. **Conclusion:** The use of ""kikes"" constitutes antisemitism by expressing negative stereotypes towards Jewish individuals.

Thus, the tweet is classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not inherently appear to be antisemitic based on the provided context. The sentence ""i love kikes"" lacks clear anti-Semitic connotations unless ""kikes"" is interpreted in a derogatory manner related to Jews, which is not indicated here.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism Definition:** Antisemitism as per JDA includes discrimination, prejudice, or hostility directed at Jews (or Jewish institutions) based on their identity.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet Content:** The tweet is a critique of Christopher Cantwell with profanity and seems to be a joke without context. There's no indication linking Cantwell to being Jewish or using antisemitic language targeting his background.

3. **Applying JDA Guidelines:**
   - **Guideline 1:** Essentializing traits as inherent doesn't apply here since the tweet is vague.
   - **Guideline 2:** No link to Jews or anti-Semitic stereotypes is present.
   - **Guidelines 4 & 5:** The tweet doesn't target specific groups based on identity without context.

4. **Conclusion:** Without evidence of antisemitic content or stereotyping, the tweet isn't classified as such by JDA standards."

This use of the term ""Nazi"" invokes anti-Semitic stereotypes, as Nazis were known for their persecution of Jews. While the tweet does not explicitly target or mention Jews, its association with Nazism is often linked to historical anti-Semitism against Jewish communities. The IHRA considers such references to be antisemitic due to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about Jews through the use of harmful associations.

The tweet uses a classic antisemitic stereotype by linking Richard Spencer to Nazism, which can be seen as implying anti-Semitic views indirectly.

Therefore, based on the IHRA's criteria and the context provided, this tweet is considered antisemitic.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully. The user wrote, ""Fuck this shit it's not worth it. Niggers are stupid, kikes are evil, beaners are a mix of both and asians are just..."" They then used an unclear abbreviation ending with ""�"".

Now, looking at the JDA guidelines. Antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. The key points to consider from the guidelines:

1. **Racism**: Essentializing traits like intelligence or treating them as a negative stereotype.
2. **Linking Jews to evil**: Any portrayal suggesting Jews are inherently evil, such as using stereotypes or conspiracy theories.
3. **Expression in words, images, deeds**: The tweet uses slurs and derogatory terms.

Looking at the tweet:
- ""Niggers"" is a term that is often used as a slur against African裔 people of mixed heritage, which can be considered antisemitic if it's applied to Jewish individuals without context.
- ""Kikes"" isn't clear, but given the context, it might refer to kinetic or something else. Without knowing its origin, it could be seen as derogatory.
- ""Beaners"" is another term that's derogatory and can be used against Black people, similarly raising red flags.
- The rest of the tweet uses generalizable terms like ""evil,"" which ties into the second guideline about linking Jews to evil forces.

The use of these terms without specific context towards Jewish individuals could be interpreted as antisemitic. Even if the user didn't intend it that way, the nature of the language aligns with harmful stereotypes and conspiracy thinking outlined in the JDA.

Additionally, the tweet's overall tone is confrontational and dismissive, which can contribute to a hostile environment. It doesn't provide any evidence-based criticism or support for equality but instead uses derogatory terms.

Therefore, considering all these points, the tweet does meet the criteria of antisemitism as defined by the JDA.
</think>

DECISION: No

The tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

While the tweet contains derogatory and offensive language such as ""Niggers,"" ""kikes,"" and ""beaners"" which can be interpreted as slurs against African裔 individuals, it does so without targeting specific Jewish people. The JDA emphasizes that antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group, not against individual races. The tweet's use of generalizable terms like ""evil"" aligns more with broader conspiracy theories rather than direct antisemitic attacks on Jewish people.

The JDA focuses on harmful stereotypes and conspiracies that link Jews to negative traits, but the tweet does not specifically target Jewish individuals or present evidence-based criticism of Israel/Palestine. Instead, it uses derogatory language without context towards Jewish people, which could be seen as a broader slur against Black individuals rather than antisemitic.

In conclusion, while the language is offensive and contains harmful stereotypes, it doesn't specifically target Jewish people in an antisemitic manner according to the JDA guidelines."

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the tweet from Richard Spencer is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition provided.

First, let's recall the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. It says that antisemitism involves a perception or expression of hatred toward Jews, both towards individuals and their property, community institutions, etc. The examples given include calling for harm in name of radical ideology, making dehumanizing allegations about Jews as a people, accusing them of conspiracies, denying the Holocaust, using Nazi symbols, comparing Israeli policies to the Nazis, etc.

Now looking at the tweet: ""Richard Spencer is a fucking Nazi. Don't believe it? Listen to this."" The user also added some emojis but mainly the text. So the main point here is that Richard Spencer is labeled as a Nazi.

I know that Richard Spencer was a conspiracy theorist and white supremacist who claimed that Jews are behind numerous conspiracies, including 9/11. He's associated with QAnon, which promotes antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories. So labeling him as a Nazi might be based on these associations rather than any direct reference to Nazis.

But according to the IHRA definition, it's about perception of hatred toward Jews. The tweet is accusing Richard Spencer of being a Nazi, but it doesn't specifically target Jews or express hatred towards them directly. Instead, it labels him as someone who supports antisemitic views by associating with groups that promote conspiracy theories against Jews.

So does this count as antisemitism under IHRA? Let's break it down:

- Is there a perception of hatred toward Jews here? Richard Spencer is being called a Nazi, which implies anti-Semitic associations. However, the tweet itself doesn't directly say anything about Jews or express any negative perception towards them; it's more about Richard Spencer and associating him with negative stereotypes.

- The examples given by IHRA include accusing a group of people (like Jews) as a people of conspiracies or being responsible for wrongdoing. In this case, the tweet is associating Richard Spencer with the Nazi ideology through QAnon's conspiracy theories.

But wait, does this count as antisemitism because it's based on the association with a person who has ties to antisemitic groups? The IHRA definition mentions that sometimes people are accused of conspiracies involving Jews, but in this case, it's Richard Spencer being labeled as a Nazi without directly targeting him as a Jew. However, since he is associated with anti-Semitic ideologies and QAnon, which promotes antisemitism, the tweet could be seen as promoting or reinforcing those ideas.

Alternatively, if someone labels Richard Spencer as a Nazi because of his ties to QAnon, it might not directly target Jews but rather a figure who supports anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. However, under IHRA's working definition, if such a label is used to associate with groups that promote antisemitism, it could still be considered antisemitic in context.

But I think the key here is whether the tweet itself expresses hatred toward Jews or uses any of the prohibited expressions like accusing them of conspiracies, denying their right to self-determination, etc. The tweet doesn't mention anything about Jews directly; it's more about Richard Spencer and his associations. However, by calling him a Nazi, which could be linked to QAnon's anti-Semitic views, it might be promoting or reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes.

But wait, the IHRA definition says that expressions of hatred can target individuals as well as institutions. So if someone labels Richard Spencer as a Nazi because of his association with anti-Semitic groups, does that count? I'm not sure. The tweet doesn't explicitly say anything against Jews; it's more about Richard Spencer and his beliefs.

Alternatively, the IHRA example includes accusing Jewish people or states of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. This tweet isn't doing that but is associating someone with Nazi ideas through QAnon. So maybe it's not directly antisemitic because it's not targeting Jews but rather a figure who promotes anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.

Wait, perhaps the IHRA allows for such expressions if they are based on accurate stereotypes or associations. But I think in this case, Richard Spencer is a well-known figure with clear ties to QAnon and anti-Semitism, so labeling him as a Nazi might be considered promoting antisemitic views indirectly.

But then again, the tweet doesn't directly attribute any negative traits to Jews; it's more about Richard Spencer. So maybe it's not directly antisemitic but rather an expression of personal dislike towards Richard Spencer based on his associations with anti-Semitic groups.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. On one hand, the IHRA defines antisemitism in terms of expressions targeting Jews or their properties, etc. The tweet doesn't do that; it's about Richard Spencer and his connection to Nazi-like beliefs through QAnon.

But another angle: if someone calls a figure like Richard Spencer a Nazi because they're associated with anti-Semitic groups, is that considered antisemitic? I think the IHRA would consider such an act as promoting or reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes, which could be seen as antisemitic in context.

Alternatively, maybe it's not directly antisemitic but more of a conspiracy-mongering tweet. However, under IHRA's definition, if the tweet is using Nazi-like terms to describe someone associated with anti-Semitic ideologies, it might still fall under their working definition because it's promoting harmful stereotypes about Jews through Richard Spencer.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the examples again: ""accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group"" etc. So if someone labels a person like Richard Spencer as a Nazi, which is based on their association with anti-Semitic groups, it's promoting the idea that Jews are behind such conspiracies.

So in this case, the tweet is contributing to the perception of Jews being involved in these conspiracies through Richard Spencer's actions. Therefore, it might be seen as aiding or justifying antisemitism by promoting the idea that Jews are behind the creation of these conspiracies.

Therefore, perhaps the tweet does fall under antisemitic territory because it's associating Richard Spencer with Nazi-like beliefs, thereby contributing to the perception of Jews being involved in such conspiracies.
</think>

The tweet in question can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Expression of Hatred or Stereotypes**: The tweet labels Richard Spencer as a Nazi, which is associated with anti-Semitic ideologies through groups like QAnon. This could be seen as promoting or reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes.

2. **Association with Antisemitic Groups**: By associating Richard Spencer with QAnon and its promotion of conspiracy theories against Jews, the tweet indirectly supports anti-Semitic views without directly targeting Jews.

3. **Promotion of Antisemitic Ideals**: The tweet contributes to the perception that Jews are involved in creating or supporting conspiracies related to Nazi ideology, aligning with IHRA's definition by promoting harmful stereotypes about Jews through a figure associated with such ideologies.

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet uses unclear terms like ""@ative Americans"", ""iggers"", and ""kikes"" which do not relate to Jews or any negative stereotypes associated with them.
2. **Lack of Antisemitic Elements**: There is no mention of antisemitic symbols, caricatures, or coded language tied to Jews. The tweet seems directed at a generic American audience without targeting specific Jewish groups.
3. **Guidelines Compliance**: Since there's no reference to any of the JDA guidelines related to antisemitism (such as essentializing traits, linking Jews to negative stereotypes, or using prohibited forms of speech), the tweet does not violate these standards.

While the tweet refers to ""white supremacists,"" it uses this term to demean and disempower people of color, potentially associating them with negative connotations aimed at Jews or Black communities. The language is harmful and intended to perpetuate prejudice against an ethnic group.",No,"The tweet in question is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses offensive racial slurs such as ""niggers,"" ""wetbacks,"" and ""chinks"" to denigrate Black individuals. These terms are deeply discriminatory and harmful, targeting specific groups based on their perceived characteristics. The tweet also associates these groups with white supremacists in a way that implies malevolence or control, further escalating antisemitic ideology. There is no attempt to promote equality or justice for Black people; instead, the message reinforces harmful stereotypes and divisory thinking."
1198743116112695297,_Yuri_Desu_,2019-11-24 23:20:05+00:00,1,Kikes,Shut the fuck up Derek only reason ur not depressed is you'll gradly take checks from a bunch of kikes at adult swim,No,"Based on the analysis of the provided IHRA definition, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism. While the language used (""Shut the fuck up,"" ""gradly take checks"") is harsh, there is no specific reference to Jews or any context suggesting that ""kikes"" refers to a Jewish group negatively. Without clear evidence linking ""kikes"" to Jews and without targeting individuals or property specifically based on Jewish identity, the tweet does not fit within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.

However, it is important to note that the language used could potentially be interpreted as stereotyping Derek if ""kikes"" is associated with a specific Jewish community. In this case, the tweet may inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes rather than explicitly targeting Jews. Therefore, while there isn't direct evidence of antisemitic intent in the given tweet, its tone and potential references could fall under broader categorizations that align with antisemitism if context indicates such associations.

Ultimately, without explicit reference to Jews or a clear offensive term directed at them, this tweet is not explicitly identified as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or mention Jews or any antisemitic stereotypes related to them. While the term ""kikes"" could imply racial slurs against Black people, it is not clear that this reference is directed at Jews specifically. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, which focus on explicit discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a population, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic.

Note: The term ""kikes"" may carry racial connotations, but without specific references to Jews or their institutions, it doesn't fit within the antisemitism definition provided by JDA."

Additionally, while targeting Black individuals with terms like ""Whitey"" and ""Crackers"" may perpetuate harmful stereotypes, the primary antisemitism lies in the derogatory mention of Jews.

By comparing them to ""kikes"" (a derogatory term for Black individuals) and associating them with ""extreme left"" and ""terror,"" it applies harmful stereotypes that fit within the category of antisemitic rhetoric. This approach perpetuates prejudice without addressing individual characteristics, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving the use of negative traits to target a group.",No,"The tweet contains the word ""kikes,"" which is a derogatory term historically used to demean and stereotype Jews. This aligns with JDA Guideline 1, as essentializing an entire group into such a label constitutes antisemitism. Additionally, it reflects historical practices of antisemitism by portraying Jews as threats or terrorists, fitting the criteria in Guidelines 2 and 3. The term lacks any basis for respect and directly attacks the Jewish community without justification.
