It is a historical reference to the role of Jews in Shanghai during the Holocaust, presented without targeting or negative perceptions towards them. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not contain any antisemitic content as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

These elements align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as involving demening language and negative perceptions directed at Jews or their communities.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration. By labeling the ""Jews"" in Israel as part of a 5th Column Leftist group, it associates them with oppositional activities, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes about their identity and loyalties. Additionally, the use of the term ""Jewtastic"" may perpetuate anti-Semitic stereotypes by simplifying or reducing their complexities. The tweet also indirectly criticizes Jewish people within a political context, which could be viewed as denying their right to exist based on their identity. These actions collectively constitute antisemitism under the JDA guidelines."

It references historical contexts, such as comparisons between 2020 and early 1940s, which could be interpreted as perpetuating negative stereotypes or justifying actions against Jewish people. Specifically, the mention of ""excuses to kill Jews"" draws attention to historical atrocities associated with Jews, potentially inciting hatred and fear. While the tweet does not explicitly use harmful stereotypes about Jews like demonizing them or associating them with violence, its context aligns with historical antisemitic narratives that could be used to justify negative actions against Jewish people. Therefore, it can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA's working definition.",Yes,"The tweet incorporates references to ""Nazis"" and mentions ""excuses to kill Jews,"" both of which align with the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism. These elements link Jews to harmful ideologies, referencing historical atrocities like the Holocaust, thus constituting antisemitic content."

By suggesting that their wealth was stolen without just cause by neighboring governments, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jewish people. Additionally, the rhetorical question and hashtag usage frame Jews as absent or complicit in negative actions, aligning with antisemitic behaviors that target specific communities based on ethnicity or religion.

The tweet's use of historical grievances framed against Jewish people in Arab countries, combined with its negative generalization of their wealth as stolen, fits within the IHRA definition. It employs exclusionary rhetoric and stereotypes, which are hallmarks of antisemitism. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic by the given standards.",No,"The tweet does not present any antisemitic content. It discusses historical events regarding Jews in Arab countries, specifically highlighting their expulsion and the theft of their wealth over 70 years ago.

This expression of hatred toward Jews through speech, which fits within the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving negative stereotypes and statements about Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet contains several instances of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Anti-Semitic Language**: The tweet refers to Jews as ""deceivers,"" which is a harmful stereotype that equates Jews with deceit and negativity, fitting the definition of antisemitism.

2. **Conspiracy and Discrimination Claims**: By stating that Coronavirus was sent by God to kill transgender people, the tweet implies a direct conspiracy theory against non-Jewish communities (transgender individuals), although this does not directly target Jews but still involves harmful discrimination.

3. **Generalization**: The term ""brown invasion"" used to describe immigrants could be interpreted as a broad generalization about immigrants, potentially contributing to antisemitism by associating Jewish people with negative connotations in other contexts indirectly.

All these elements together make the tweet antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines."

While it implies that being white and Jewish disqualifies one from being racist, this statement is more about societal norms regarding racism rather than explicitly targeting individuals or groups based on their Jewish identity. Antisemitism under IHRA requires directed hatred or discrimination towards specific individuals or communities, which the tweet does not achieve. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet ""white Jews are not exempt from being racist..."" does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While the mention of ""white Jews"" could imply a stereotype, the tweet does not engage in discrimination based on Jewish identity. Instead, it associates a specific racial group within Judaism with malice, potentially essentializing an entire subgroup rather than addressing broader antisemitic issues. The JDA emphasizes targeting the entire Jewish population, not specific subgroups unless it escalates to denying their existence or rights. Therefore, without broader antisemitic content or denial of other Jewish identities, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism."

Instead, it presents a comparison between Samaritans and Jews as two distinct groups, without targeting or stigmatizing Jews. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which involves a specific negative attitude towards Jews, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic.

**Final Answer:**

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet ""why can't both the samaritans and the jews be favored by God"" does not exhibit characteristics of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It poses a neutral question comparing two groups without engaging in discriminatory language, essentializing, or linking Jews to harmful stereotypes. The tweet avoids the specific guidelines outlined for antisemitic content, such as denial of Jewish rights, use of negative imagery, or historical conspiracies involving Jews. Therefore, it does not constitute antisemitism."

While it may carry connotations suggesting a negative view of Jews beyond mere criticism of the state, IHRA's definition requires specific targeting of Jewish communities or their actions and attributes. Therefore, this tweet does not meet all the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly attack or stereotype Jews based on their ethnicity; instead, it critiques Israel as representing colonialism and thus potentially implying broader accusations. However, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews specifically. Since the tweet does not target Jews directly but rather attacks the state's perceived role, which could be interpreted as indirectly affecting Jewish interests without overtly prejudging them, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA guidelines."

While it refers to media platforms' restrictions on discussing certain groups, including Jews, and mentions an incident with Nick Cannon who made a statement about Black people being ""true Hebrews,"" the context provided is more of a commentary on media policies rather than an overtly antisemitic expression. The tweet does not use rhetoric that fits the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which requires specific hatred or negative expressions directed at Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits elements that align with antisemitic practices according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It restricts discussion about reparations for a specific group, which could be seen as a form of discrimination or stigmatization. Additionally, the reference to Nick Cannon calling Black people ""true Hebrews"" perpetuates stereotypes and associates Jewish identity with negative traits, contributing to antisemitic content. These actions involve essentializing or discriminating against Jews based on their identity, thus aligning with JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

However, it is used in conjunction with a mention of @realDonaldTrump flags, suggesting a neutral context that does not inherently demonize or target Jewish communities negatively beyond their role as synagogues and Jewish communities. Since the primary action described is a peaceful protest against closures without overtly promoting or associating with any negative stereotypes beyond the star of David, which could be interpreted in a peaceful or symbolic manner within the context provided, it does not fully meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet in question uses symbols, specifically @realDonaldTrump flags, and employs language to target the Jewish community explicitly by singling them out. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as it involves discrimination and targeting a specific group (Jews) through symbols and explicit mention."

It presents historical information about Germany's treatment of genocidal events against two distinct groups: Jews (1933-1945) and Namibians (1904-1908).

The statements are factual and do not accuse or stereotype Jews, making them non-antisemitic according to IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet addresses a factual correction regarding Germany's handling of Namibian genocides and does not contain any antisemitic content.

What a schmendrick. https://t.co/hCN0MMtq43,Yes,"The tweet equates American Jews with Israelis, suggesting that their identity is linked to Israel rather than the United States. This reduces Jewish Americans to a stereotypical association with another nation, potentially downplaying their status as U.S. citizens and implying discrimination against them. While the use of ""schmendrick"" might not be inherently derogatory here, the broader implication aligns with antisemitic themes by demonizing Jewish Americans through such associations. Therefore, it qualifies as antisemitic according to IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet in question makes a statement about Trump's perceived beliefs linking American Jews with Israelis and characterizing this view as ""a schmendrick."" While the term ""schmendrick"" is derogatory, the tweet does not explicitly target specific Jewish individuals but rather critiques Trump's political stance. Although it may imply a stereotype associating Jews with Israelis in a negative way, the primary intent is to mock Trump rather than directly engage in antisemitic behavior targeting Jewish people. Therefore, while there are elements suggesting potential antisemitic tendencies, the tweet does not meet all the criteria of JDA's definition due to its focus on mocking Trump rather than specific Jewish individuals or communities."

It is neutral and factual, advertising an auction sale related to properties left by Jews after their deportation. There are no indications of hatred directed toward specific Jewish individuals or groups, nor are there any discriminatory slurs or stereotypes implied. The tweet's content does not constitute antisemitism as it lacks explicit hate speech, discriminatory language, or targeted attacks on Jewish people.",No,"The tweet does not present as antisemitic. It describes an auction sale of properties left by Jews after their deportation to Hanau, Germany. This action is neutral; it does not involve any form of discrimination, prejudice, or hostility against Jews. There are no elements in the tweet that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, such as using symbols, images, or negative stereotypes associated with Jews, nor does it express solidarity with Palestinian rights or deny Jewish rights in Israel. It is a straightforward statement about property sales without any antisemitic undertones."

That Jews conspired to dominate the world using their money and intelligence to manipulate trusting Christians."" https://t.co/y98V1qzjTh",Yes,"The tweet makes broad, stereotypical claims about Jews conspiring to dominate the world and manipulate Christians, which aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. It employs harmful stereotypes by generalizing against Jews, potentially justifying discrimination without providing factual support for its claims.",Yes,"The tweet uses the trope of Jews conspiring to dominate the world using their money and intelligence, which is a classic example of antisemitic stereotypes. This aligns with guideline 2, where Jews are linked to forces of evil, and guideline 3, as it portrays Jews in a way that equates them with manipulation and hidden conspiracies against others.

The tweet also uses the stereotype of Jews as powerful masterminds behind global control, which is a common element in antisemitic rhetoric. By associating Jews with such conspiratorial activities directed at Christians or other groups, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases that are defined by the JDA. 

Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet exhibits antisemitism as it essentializes Jews into a group capable of manipulating global dynamics through their assumed intelligence and financial power.

1232766439427317760,treehouseheroic,2020-02-26 20:36:37+00:00,0,Jews,You know who has the luxury to not worry about security? Those who have it. It's a bit rich of American Jews to sit in America and tell Israel what it does &amp; doesn't need to survive.\n\nUnless you don't think we should survive at all.,Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it specifically targets American Jews, expressing a judgment on their security capabilities and suggesting they shouldn't be involved in decisions about Israel's survival. This reflects antisemitism by singling out Jewish individuals for criticism without broader stereotypes or prejudice.

The tweet uses language that implies American Jews have superior security and thus should not worry about Israel's actions, which could be interpreted as a form of exclusionary comment against the Jewish people. While it doesn't explicitly use classic stereotypical language, its targeting aligns with antisemitic principles by focusing on a specific Jewish group without considering their contributions or well-being.

Additionally, the tweet implies that survival is only a concern for non-Jews, which could be seen as stretching towards problematic associations with Nazi policies, though this isn't directly stated. Overall, these elements meet the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. It uses stigmatization directed at American Jews, implying they lack concern for their own security compared to others. This aligns with guidelines 7-10, which involve collectively blaming or treating a group (here, American Jews) negatively towards another entity (Israel). The tweet employs exclusionary language and stereotypes, fitting within the definition of antisemitism by targeting a specific group without proper context or respect for their actual needs regarding security."

Specifically:

1. **Targeting Israel**: The tweet refers to ""the end of the Jewish state"" which implies a negative portrayal of Israel, potentially targeting it as an entity.

2. **Historical Context Against Specific Groups**: By mentioning that Mizrahi Jews were ethnically cleansed by Arab countries in the 1940s and 50s, it directs criticism specifically to a subset of the Jewish community (Mizrahim), which is often used to carry historical blame.

3. **Denying Rights of Self-Determination**: The tweet implies that Israel's existence is a racist project, directly engaging with the notion of self-determination denied to Jews under IHRA's definition.

4. **Implication of Persecution**: Referring to constant Hamas rocket fire affecting Mizrahi Jews in Israel may be seen as EITHER an accurate criticism of current conditions or as discrimination against them based on their Jewish identity.

5. **Conspiracy Implication**: Although not explicitly stated, the call for an end to the ""Jewish state"" might conflate with conspiracy theories linking Jews to negative actions, aligning with antisemitic accusations.

Therefore, the tweet meets multiple criteria under IHRA's definition, making it considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits several elements of antisemitism according to the JDA. It equates being a comfortable Westerner advocating for the end of Israel with the priviledge of others, while stigmatizing specific Jewish groups (Mizrahi Jews) for their suffering due to historical actions and ongoing persecution by Hamas. This involves discrimination based on ethnicity, applying negative stereotypes tied to the ""Jewish state,"" and promoting harmful associations that equate suffering with a group's identity. These actions align with JDA's guidelines on antisemitism, particularly regarding denial of rights, symbolic representation, and associating Jews with harmful forces or identities."

By suggesting that authorities are checking for ""Jews inside,"" it may perpetuate the stereotype that Jews are responsible for certain actions or behaviors, thereby exhibiting antisemitic behavior as described in guidelines 6 and 7.

However, upon closer inspection:

The tweet employs language that could be interpreted as using negative stereotypes tied to evil against a personal figure, which under the JDA guidelines (specifically point 2) could imply antisemitic elements. While not directly addressing a group of Jews, the use of broad statements about ""evil plans"" and ""Jews"" without specific evidence against Mr. Khamenei individually might be seen as projecting negative stereotypes onto him in a way that could align with antisemitic practices when applied to groups like Jews.

But since the tweet is directed at a specific leader rather than a group, it does not meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism which involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a whole. The guidelines emphasize treating an entire population, so this tweet, while using potentially off-putting language, doesn't sufficiently address a group as defined by the JDA.

Therefore, the tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA because it does not involve systematic discrimination or generalization against Jews."

The tweet includes a stereotypical label (""socialist"") directed at them, but this is more of a stereotype-based criticism rather than direct antisemitism targeting their Jewishness.

In this case, the tweet does not explicitly target them as Jewish individuals; instead, it critiques their voting record on social issues and wealth distribution, which is a form of political speech. The JDA emphasizes that political speech does not inherently have to be tempered to be protected under human rights principles, so even harsh or critical remarks in this context do not amount to antisemitism.

It merely suggests a cultural exchange and does not involve any discriminatory or harmful remarks against Jews, Israel, or related topics.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. **Understanding Antisemitism**: The IHRA defines antisemitism as hatred toward Jews, expressed through various means like speech, symbols, or discrimination.
2. **Analyzing the Tweet**: The tweet is about a greeting style among Jews and doesn't target anyone negatively based on Jewish identity.
3. **Checking for Antisemitic Elements**: It lacks any mention of Israel, Holocaust denial, conspiracy theories, or antisemitic stereotypes.
4. **Conclusion**: Since there's no discriminatory intent or content aligning with IHRA criteria, the tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet uses the term ""adaab,"" which is often used to refer to people of color. By suggesting that Jews should adopt this greeting and using it in a context that could be interpreted as ethnic discrimination, the tweet violates the principles of antisemitism outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The use of a term of endearment directed at Jews without context or understanding can perpetuate stereotypes and is therefore considered antisemitic."

Any pro-democracy supporter can get arrested in #HongKong, then shipped to a gulag in mainland China where many will not survive. We can't let this happen again! The international community must intervene! https://t.co/IUrAZOanXE",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It uses historical references like Nazi Germany targeting Jews to justify persecution against pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong and mainland China, employing violent imagery (gulag) that normalizes anti-Semitic stereotypes. By equating these groups with persecution and suggesting many won't survive, it stigmatizes Jews and spreads fear without addressing the actual grievances of those groups. This aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, involving hatred and stereotyping directed at Jews.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews and uses general language about pro-democracy supporters being arrested in Hong Kong and sent to a gulag. It doesn't employ any of the JDA guidelines for antisemitism, such as essentializing Jews or using coded symbols related to antisemitism. Instead, it addresses broader issues of human rights globally without making specific negative judgments about Jewish people.
