It does not generalize or target all Jews but focuses on a specific religious and cultural subgroup. There is no use of hateful language or stereotypical terms implying antisemitism. Therefore, it does not meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as it does not broadly or negatively stereotype an entire group of Jews.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet specifically targets Based Orthodox Jews and criticizes them for rejecting public health measures imposed by Mayor de Blasio. However, it does not engage in any form of discrimination or prejudice based on Jewish identity. Instead, it is a critique of individual actions rather than making broad generalizations or using negative stereotypes associated with antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet does not constitute antisemitism under the JDA framework."

This aligns with the IHRA's definition as it involves expressing hatred toward Jews through speech, in this case using a negative stereotype that targets their collective image. Additionally, the tweet implies a lower status for Jews compared to other groups like Muslims and Hindus, further perpetuating antisemitic views by focusing on their perceived lesser value.

The use of ""pet dog"" is particularly harmful as it associates Jews with negativity beyond personal characteristics, contributing to antisemitism by reinforcing stereotypes about their group. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for being antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not directly qualify as antisemitic under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it contains elements that touch on religious preference and uses metaphors to describe Jews, it does not meet any of the specific guidelines or examples outlined in the JDA. The primary issue is not the essentialization or stereotype use but rather its broader context as a discussion on religious preferences without directly challenging Jews collectively."

While it criticizes the mayor's actions, it is a general statement about the mayor's behavior without specifically targeting Jewish individuals, properties, or communities. Antisemitism involves directed opposition against Jews themselves, and this tweet does not meet that criterion since it remains focused on the mayor's approach rather than any negative perception of Jews.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet specifically targets Jews by name and implies they are being unfairly targeted by law enforcement, which constitutes discrimination based on race. This aligns with JDA's definition of antisemitism as it involves attacking Jews directly and stereotyping them through language that associates them with negative actions. Additionally, the mention of the DOJ investigating constitutional violations for religious liberties further escalates the stereotypical nature of the tweet, reinforcing biases against Jews."

By framing the creation of ""protocols"" as possibly antisemitic, it associates the production of these documents with antisemitism, thereby assigning a negative trait to Jewish people. This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes expressions of hatred and assigning negative character traits directed at Jewish individuals or communities.",No,"The tweet in question is ""@jentaub @FBIRecordsVault @HouseJudiciary @senjudiciary @FBI AnTi-SeMitic? Jews wrote the protocols!!!"". Based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, or hostile behavior directed at Jews as a group. The tweet mentions ""Jews wrote the protocols,"" which could be interpreted as a stereotypical statement about Jews if it implies a generalization without context. However, in this case, referring to ""protocols"" might relate to official documents or technical work without inherently negative connotations. Without additional context suggesting a broader stereotype or essentializing behavior, the tweet does not appear to violate JDA guidelines. It could be seen as acknowledging contributions made by Jewish people rather than making a biased generalization."

It raises concerns about why two minority groups, Jews and Blacks, support Democrats, which are associated with opposition to oppression. However, it does not specifically target Jews, nor does it employ harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories directly aimed at them. Instead, it makes a generalized critique of a political party without specific antisemitic language or slants towards Jewish people. Therefore, while it may touch on sensitive topics, it does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jews explicitly or using inappropriate language.",Yes,"The tweet indirectly employs stereotyping by associating support for Democrats with both Black individuals and Jewish people, suggesting that this support is due to oppression. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines, particularly point 2, where Jews are linked to evil through stereotypes, and using such language can perpetuate antisemitism.

The tweet uses terms like ""oppressing"" which can reinforce negative perceptions of Jews, despite targeting another group (Blacks) primarily. However, by extension, it touches on antisemitic themes, making the overall statement antisemitic according to the JDA."

This term perpetuates a hostile perception of Jewish individuals or groups and aligns with the IHRA's definition, which categorizes such language as antisemitic due to its dehumanizing nature. As HillelNeuer represents Jewish communities, using this slur towards them undermines their legitimate interests and adheres to the principles of antisemitism outlined by the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet employs the racial slur ""Dirty Jews,"" which directly discriminates against Jews. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes discrimination and essentializing populations based on their identity, including labeling them with harmful stereotypes or slurs. Therefore, using a racial slur that targets Jews constitutes antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It does not exhibit any form of hatred toward Jews, nor does it use any antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or criticisms that would align with IHRA's definition. Instead, it provides data objectively without any overtly antisemitic language or actions. Therefore, the tweet is not classified as antisemitic under the IHRA criteria.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Ethiopian Jews"" to imply that this specific subgroup is overrepresented in incarceration rates compared to their societal proportion. According to the JDA, antisemitism includes stereotyping and singling out particular Jewish groups without justification, which aligns with point 7. This statement targets a specific subgroup within the broader Jewish population, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes and thereby contributing to antisemitism."

While it suggests that Jews are being improperly used (""appropriated"" capital) and could imply a broader criticism of their role in society, the mention also includes other groups like LGBTQ and ethnic communities without a clear focus on Jewish people specifically beyond their name. The IHRA definition emphasizes targeting Jewish individuals or institutions explicitly, which is not fully addressed here. Therefore, while there are potential elements that might touch on antisemitic themes, they do not meet all the criteria outlined in the definition when considering specificity to Jewish individuals.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly use any antisemitic stereotypes or essentialize Jews as inherently negative. It critiques general policy ideas without directly referencing Jews in a negative light, thus aligning more with neutral political discourse rather than antisemitic content."

This aligns with the IHRA definition, as it involves an overt expression of negative stereotypes and hatred directed at Jews.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it involves making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews. The speaker criticizes Jews as a group without providing specific evidence and instead relies on stereotypes and personal experiences, which are problematic under the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

The tweet uses essentializing by labeling all Jews negatively based on someone's past experience, contributing to antisemitism. This aligns with the guidelines that emphasize treating a character trait as inherent or making broad generalizations about a population. Therefore, it meets the criteria for antisemitic speech according to the JDA."

Imagine if Jews had stayed quiet and Corbyn had won.   What would be happening now?,No,The tweet does not meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It critiques actions directed at Jews in public discourse but does not express hatred or any form of discrimination against them. The statements are more political commentaries without targeting individuals based on their Jewish identity.,Yes,"The tweet employs stereotyping by associating Jews with negative behavior directed at Corbyn supporters. It suggests that if Jews had remained silent about Corbyn, a different outcome would have occurred, implying Jews are collectively problematic. This aligns with JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly its stereotyping elements and coded language linking Jews to harmful actions."

It perpetuates harmful stereotypes by associating Jews with negative actions and failing to consider historical context or alternative perspectives. These elements align with antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet does not align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism because it is a general statement about responsibility over history without targeting Jews specifically or employing any of the defined forms of antisemitic speech.

Antisemitism according to IHRA requires a specific target, typically a Jewish person or community, and involves acts of hatred expressed through words, actions, or symbols. The tweet targets an individual without identifying them as Jewish, nor does it provide context suggesting such an identity. Additionally, the nature of the comment is more personal than systemic, lacking the systemic implications often associated with antisemitism. Therefore, while the tweet expresses negative sentiments towards Jews, it does not clearly target a specific Jewish individual or meet the detailed criteria IHRA outlines for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet ""@robbysoave You hate jews."" is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet employs a stereotypical and essentializing statement that implies a general dislike for Jews without providing specific context or evidence. This aligns with JDA's definition of antisemitism, which involves discrimination, prejudice, or hostility against Jews as a population. The statement does not reference particular individuals, actions, or provide evidence-based criticism but instead reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews in a way that is consistent with antisemitic behavior."

This constitutes a form of antisemitism as it attacks the humanity of Jews in an inappropriate manner, fitting within the definition provided by the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet uses the derogatory term ""Kapo,"" which is widely recognized as anti-Semitic and implies that all Jews are parasites or dependents. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly point 2, where Jews are stereotyped as evil individuals without justification. Additionally, point 7 emphasizes treating Jews collectively as agents of a negative force, reinforcing antisemitic behavior by assigning blame based on ethnicity. The use of ""us Jews"" and the derogatory term commit to the definition of antisemitism outlined in JDA."

This aligns with antisemitism as defined by IHRA, where negative traits or stereotypes about Jews are expressed.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines for several reasons. Firstly, Farrakhan refers to Democrats as ""murderer"" and ""vile anti-Semitic terrorist,"" directly using anti-Semitic language that discriminates against Jews by associating them with negative traits. This constitutes hostile generalization. Secondly, while the tweet may use a stereotype regarding Florida's role in COVID-19 relief efforts without specific context about Jews' involvement, the primary issue lies in the direct and offensive anti-Semitic remarks directed at Democrats, which are protected under JDA as they essentialize an entire group with negative attributes."

This equates Jews with a negative stereotype of leaders, potentially leading to hatred or discrimination against them by association. This stereotyping aligns with the IHRA definition as it employs negative character traits and harmful analogies.",No,"The tweet in question does not appear to be antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence directed specifically at Jews. It outlines that essentializing groups or linking them to negative traits is problematic, and that antisemitic language or behavior often involves coded imagery or stereotypes. The tweet in question is a critique of the New York Times for publishing opeds that call for the end of Israel. This critique does not involve any form of discrimination, prejudice, or essentialization targeting Jews. It simply questions editorial decisions without engaging in any stereotypical or discriminatory language. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria outlined in the JDA as being antisemitic.

The tweet's focus is on the editorial stance of a newspaper rather than any negative stereotype, harmful imagery, or discriminatory actions directed at Jewish people. Thus, it does not fit within the definitions provided by the JDA for antisemitism."

It does not exhibit any form of hatred towards Jews, nor does it use any negative stereotypes, antigens, or symbols associated with antisemitism. Instead, it emphasizes collaboration and pluralism among Jewish voices, which aligns with promoting diversity without incitement to hatred or discrimination.

The tweet is neutral, factual, and does not attack the validity of historical events related to the Holocaust or invoke any harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories that could be misinterpreted as antisemitic. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet promotes diversity among Jews by stating ""Jews have never spoken with just one voice,"" which celebrates the presence of multiple Jewish perspectives. It does not target any group negatively, avoid stereotypical symbols or images tied to antisemitism, nor does it advocate for exclusion based on race.

It focuses on historical context and does not present antisemitic stereotypes or generalizations about Jews. However, it is important to note that including Jewish victims within the narrative can sometimes be seen as problematic if it implies a negative role for Jews in historical events, even without direct accusation. Thus, while not overtly antisemitic in this instance, it could potentially touch on sensitive territory worth addressing."

Rules seem to be changing fast this year. https://t.co/V9Kex77liL,Yes,"The tweet employs stereotyping by linking Joe Biden's reputation with negative attributes and then using that to imply hatred towards Jews. It associates a public figure with ""bad people"" and suggests that it's acceptable or even necessary to hate Jews, which reflects antisemitic stereotypes and prejudice against the Jewish community.

The tweet does not directly target an individual but uses a group (Jews) as a basis for judgment, aligning with antisemitism as defined by IHRA. The use of percentages and the implication that it's acceptable to hate them further supports this categorization under antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it explicitly endorses hating Jews, directly targeting their group identity. It uses a negative stereotype (""hate"") to generalize about a specific minority group, which contravenes the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their Jewishness without positive regard.

The tweet employs a form of stereotyping by labeling a segment of the American population that includes Jews as ""bad people,"" which is problematic. It does not provide evidence to support this generalization, making it a significant and harmful statement against Jews. This aligns with guideline 2(1), which emphasizes essentializing or treating a character trait as inherent without justification.

Furthermore, according to guideline 5, denying the Holocaust by suggesting that it did not occur is also antisemitic, but in this case, the tweet goes beyond denial by actively promoting hate against Jews. Thus, while it doesn't explicitly deny the Holocaust, its content aligns with antisemitism through targeted and negative judgments.

In summary, the tweet's statement about hating Jews directly and explicitly discriminates against them without any mitigation based on their Jewish identity, making it a clear instance of antisemitism under the JDA."

While it might touch on a broader theme of responsibility, there's no clear indication of discrimination based on Jewish identity as defined by the JDA guidelines.

The tweet expresses protection without directly addressing negative stereotypes or implying Jews are agents of other issues, so it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA."

It includes an accusation against Jews by placing them in a group that collectively hates liberals, using broad categories but specifically targeting Jews. This involves expressing hatred towards Jews through speech and categorizing them along with other haters to target a broader group (liberals). The use of negative stereotypes and the promotion of a hostile environment within Fox News contribute to this antisemitic behavior by implying that Jews are part of this negative dynamic, thus fulfilling the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet in question does not directly target or essentialize hate toward Jews based on their Jewish identity. Instead, it broadly accuses Fox News of being a space where various haters gather and label others as hating liberals. While the tweet implies that Fox News supports hate speech against multiple groups, including those with anti-Semitic connotations (e.g., associating with groups that may have hostile views towards Jews), it does not explicitly or directly link Jews to such hatred. Therefore, under the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination based on Jewish identity, this tweet is not considered antisemitic because it does not specifically target Jews beyond their inclusion in a list of haters, nor does it essentialize them with inherent negative traits tied solely to their Jewishness without broader context supporting such an interpretation."

2. **Comparative Safety Statement**: The statement about being 2x safer than the average minority in the UK could imply a stereotypical view that Jacobs are less threatening, potentially contributing to antisemitic perceptions.

3. **Mention of Israel and Nazis**: Although clarified by the user as referring to Israeli policy, this comparison could still be misinterpreted or perceived as a stereotype linking Jews with Nazi actions.

However, these elements do not fully meet the comprehensive criteria set by IHRA for antisemitism, which includes more overt forms such as direct hatred, discrimination, or demonization. Therefore, while the tweet touches on sensitive themes, it does not conclusively qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly reference or Essentialize Jews through symbols, images, or negative stereotypes related to antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

It does not explicitly use any stereotypical language or negative images associated with Jews, nor does it imply that Jews should not act in a certain way simply because they are Jewish. The message seems more like a commentary on human behavior rather than an overtly antisemitic statement.

The tweet's approach is to highlight the potential power of fear and conformity without labeling specific groups negatively beyond general human behavior observations. It does not align with any of the JDA guidelines that define what constitutes antisemitism, such as discrimination, essentializing groups, or using stereotypes against Jews. Instead, it appears to be a neutral observation about how people might react under pressure."

The tweet's statement that ""60 million jews were really massacred in the holocaust"" is factually incorrect and harmful. It downplays the severity of the Holocaust's impact on Jewish people, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes by promoting a skewed view of history.

While it references Farrakhan in parentheses as someone who hates Jews, the tweet lacks direct anti-Semitic content and instead uses a generalizable negative stereotype about anyone who criticizes Jews. IHRA considers such generalizations as contributing to antisemitism by perpetuating harmful stereotypes without evidence.

**Final Answer:**  
DECISION: No",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition. It uses a stereotypical characterization of Jews by Farrakhan, which essentializes the group as solely evil without evidence. This aligns with guideline A.1, as it involves making broad generalizations about a population, fitting the definition of antisemitism.

The tweet employs a coded form of antisemitism (hating Jews) through Farrakhan's statement, reducing Jews to haters without context or evidence. This is in line with A.2, which highlights the core idea of associating Jews with evil. The use of such stereotypes and codes contributes to the classification as antisemitic under JDA."

However, it employs a stereotype by associating people with an actor known for such views without explicitly targeting Jews or using explicit antisemitic language or stereotypes about Jews themselves. Therefore, while it touches on antisemitic themes, it does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism because it doesn't directly express hatred toward Jews or use specific antisemitic stereotypes or tropes about Jews.

The tweet is more about criticizing individuals based on their association with an actor known for promoting antisemitism, rather than making any direct or indirect references to Jews or using any of the defined forms of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet associates Mel Gibson's known antisemitic reputation with Jewish audiences watching his trailer.

While it touches on the idea of anti-Semitism, it lacks concrete references that align with the JDA's definition beyond vague categorization.

Note: Upon further reflection, while the tweet discusses anti-Semitic content generally, it could be seen as applying negative stereotypes without specific instances, which might fit under essentializing (guideline 1).

2. **Guideline 7**: By linking acts of slavery to freedom fighters and associating them with anti-Semitism, the tweet holds Jews responsible for historical atrocities, which is a form of antisemitism tied to political causes.
