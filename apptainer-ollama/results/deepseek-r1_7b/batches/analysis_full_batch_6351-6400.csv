He�s a vile Jew hating loser. Throw away your $$$.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by understanding what the IHRA considers antisemitism to be.

From the definition provided, antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews, which can manifest in various ways like speech, actions, or symbols. It includes targeting Jewish individuals, institutions, or communities and using negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews.

Looking at the tweet: ""@chelleryn99 LOL sure I have coffee but I don't donate to a Jew hater who has tea with someone who said Jews drink the blood of gentiles, who defended Sizer, who didn't notice AS in a mural, who called a murdering terrorist 'brother'. He's a vile Jew hating loser. Throw away your $$$.""

I see several points here:
1. The tweet seems to be making fun of a person named ""Jew hater"" by associating them with someone who donates to coffee (which is unrelated). It also mentions that this person has tea, which is a contradiction because they are called a Jew hater.
2. The term ""AS in a mural"" might refer to anti-Semitic symbols or the Nazi symbol, which could be a reference to the Holocaust or Nazi ideology.
3. The tweet criticizes someone who defended Sizer, possibly referring to a person involved with the Ku Klux Klan, and calls them a ""vile Jew hating loser.""
4. It ends with a call to throw away money, which might imply judgment on others based on their beliefs.

Now, breaking it down:
- The tweet uses negative language towards a person who is associated with anti-Semitic ideologies (Jew hater), calling them a loser and using terms like ""AS in a mural"" which could be referencing the Holocaust or Nazi symbols.
- It employs stereotyping by associating this person's actions with being a Jew hater, which fits into the IHRA definition as it uses negative character traits and stereotypes about Jews.
- The mention of ""Jews drink the blood of gentiles"" is a direct Holocaust denial, which is a significant antisemitic statement.

However, I should also consider if these statements are beyond what's permissible under the IHRA. The IHRA allows criticism of other countries or ideologies as long as it doesn't specifically target Jews negatively unless it's based on their Jewishness. Here, while the tweet does touch on Holocaust denial, which is a clear antisemitic act, it's presented in a way that targets an individual by associating them with anti-Semitic behavior.

Therefore, considering all these points, the tweet seems to be using several forms of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet exhibits multiple instances of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. It employs negative language and stereotypes directed towards a person associated with anti-Semitic ideologies, references Holocaust denial, and uses terms that perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes about Jews. These elements align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, making it an antisemitic statement.",Yes,"The tweet contains antisemitic content as it employs derogatory remarks targeting a person linked to Jewish individuals. It refers to a person donating tea with someone who made a comment about Jews drinking blood of gentiles and describes them as a 'Jew hater' calling a terrorist their 'brother.' These actions and language align with JDA's guidelines, particularly by using negative stereotypes and equating Jews with harmful traits."

You don't have to like or agree with the current Israeli government at all but singling out Israel's right to exist is antisemitic.,No,"The tweet in question does not constitute antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. While it raises concerns about singling out Israel for its right to exist and equates Zionism with Jewish heritage, the IHRA emphasizes that criticism of other countries unrelated to Jewish identity is permissible. Additionally, the tweet's statement about not believing in Zionism being antisemitic does not target specific Jewish communities but rather critiques a general belief in national rights based on heritage. Therefore, it does not align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving targeting or discrimination against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet supports Zionism by asserting that having a state rights claim based on Indigenous rights is a belief held by Jews, thereby singling out Israel for criticism. This aligns with JDA's criteria in section B.7, which mandates treating Jews as responsible for Israel's actions or agents of it simply because they are Jewish. The tweet equates rejecting Zionism with antisemitism, reinforcing anti-Semitic bias without justification, thus qualifying the statement as antisemitic according to the JDA."

It focuses on political dynamics and does not engage with issues related to ethnicity or antisemitism in the manner defined by the Jerusalem Declaration.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition of Antisemitism:** The tweet must meet criteria for antisemitism as per JDA guidelines.
2. **Content Analysis:** The tweet discusses a speculative political scenario involving a political group (the Party) and does not reference any Jewish individuals, groups, or use any Nazi symbols.
3. **Situational Context:** There's no indication of using coded language, symbols, or metaphors typical in antisemitic rhetoric.
4. **Conclusion:** The tweet is neutral regarding Jewish identities and doesn't employ any forms of antisemitism.

2. **Apply IHRA criteria**: Antisemitism requires hatred, negative expressions, or conspiracy theories against Jews.
3. **No elements match**: The tweet is positive, not attacking any group, so it doesn't involve antisemitic traits.
4. **Conclusion**: The tweet isn't antisemitic as it lacks the required negative intent and targeting of Jews.

Final Decision: No",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic because it does not contain any discriminatory language or imagery directed at Jews.

Cc @JFNYC1 @ReaganBattalion https://t.co/AaOEu0p4Br,No,"The tweet uses the term ""Jews"" to describe individuals who are excluded from parks, which could be interpreted as a stereotype. However, under the IHRA definition, antisemitism requires more than just a negative reference; it involves hatred or bias directed toward Jews specifically, often as part of broader patterns or conspiracy theories. The tweet does not provide evidence of such systematic behavior or context that would justify it as antisemitic. It is more of a stereotypical statement without the necessary depth to meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question states that ""This is De Commie-O�s New York.

In analyzing this tweet:

1. **General Guidelines**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews or make sweeping generalizations about the entire Jewish population. It simply states an action without judgment or criticism.

2. **Specific Antisemitic Guidelines**:
   - **Guideline 7-8 (B)**: These guidelines advise against holding Jews responsible for a state's actions or treating them as agents of that state. The tweet does not imply any such connection; it remains neutral and factual.
   - **Other Categorizations**: The tweet does not use coded language, essentialize, or make broad generalizations.

3. **Contextual Assessment**: There is no indication of discrimination or prejudice towards Jews. The tweet focuses on a specific action (closing parks) without context that would imply broader antisemitic intent.

Therefore, the tweet is neutral and does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It expresses prejudice against individuals of Jewish heritage by implying that Soros, a prominent financier known for his philanthropic work on behalf of Jewish causes, engaged in anti-Semitic practices such as taking away Jews' wealth. The language used, including references to ""Evil"" and associating Soros with the Nazis, reinforces a negative stereotype about Jews. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly through covert expressions of hatred or bias expressed verbally.

The tweet's content is harmful because it associates a known figure with anti-Semitic actions, potentially influencing a biased perception towards him based on his Jewish heritage. The use of strong and loaded language further exacerbates this negative stereotype, contributing to antisemitic ideology by denying the victim status of Jews in such incidents.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs several elements that align with JDA's guidelines:

1. **Negative Stereotypes and Links to Evil**: The tweet associates Jews with powerful figures like Paul Soros in a negative light, implying they conspired against him by stealing wealth. This ties into the JDA's guideline 2, which considers Jews linked to evil.

2. **Use of Antisemitic Imagery**: By referring to Soros as working with Nazis and suggesting Jews are evil, it uses harmful imagery typical of antisemitism found in JDA's examples under section B.

3. **Denial of Rights and Condemnation**: The tweet doesn't provide evidence for its claims but instead repeats a negative stereotype without context, reinforcing the idea that non-Israeli Jews are more loyal than others (JDA guideline 10).

4. **Requiring Public Condenation Without Justification**: The exclamation ""Evil Evil powerful man"" is an oversimplification and emotional appeal rather than a reasoned critique.

The tweet's focus is more on the context and target groups rather than explicitly targeting Jews or promoting negative stereotypes about them. It does not mention any specific acts of antisemitism but instead critiques a broader societal phenomenon that involves Jewish individuals.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism:** The tweet uses a stereotype (Jews infecting America) linked to a negative outcome involving Israel's health report, aligning with B6, which criticizes such associations.
2. **Stereotyping and Generalization:** By suggesting Jews cause infections through an Israeli health ministry report, the tweet generalizes without considering individual cases or other contributing factors, fitting B1.
3. **Negative Stereotypes:** The tweet implies that being Jewish is linked to harmful actions (infection), reinforcing harmful stereotypes that violate B6.

2. **Rejection of Historical Linkage**: By stating ""Zionism is not Judaism,"" the tweet directly addresses a stereotype that has been used to dehumanize Jews in antisemitic contexts. This challenges the association historically established between Zionism and Jewish identity, which is problematic under the JDA's framework.

3. **Neutrality vs. Stereotyping**: While presenting religious identity neutrally (Torah), the rejection of Zionism introduces a stereotyped view that disapproves of its historical role in antisemitic discourse.

**Final Answer:**

The tweet ""RT @avivaonthenet: A message from jews: acab"" is not determined to be antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.

The tweet does not provide context indicating that it intends to express any opposition or advocacy related to Israel or any specific issue tied to Jews beyond a generic call to stop something.

The tweet references points that could be seen as stretching the use of historical context to support a discriminatory position based on nationality, thereby associating being Jewish with excusing human rights violations or exempting others.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the tweet again: ""People get upset when some Muslims compare our plight/current situation to Jews in Europe circa 1920s/early 1930s. But the president tonight praised/endorsed a woman who calls Islam a 'cancer' &amp; &amp; demands Muslims be banned from public office. And most journalists have said nothing.""

I notice two main parts: one about comparisons with Jews in Europe and another about a statement made by a leader regarding Muslims.

Looking at the first part, it mentions that some Muslims compare their situation to Jews in Europe during the 1920s-30s. According to JDA guidelines, antisemitism can be manifesting in comparing groups as equivalent or worse than Jews. So this could be considered antisemitic if such comparisons are made.

The second part talks about a president endorsing a woman who labels Islam as a ""cancer"" and demands Muslim ban from public office. This sounds like promoting anti-Muslim statements, which would definitely be antisemitic as it's making negative judgments against an entire group based on their religion.

Now, applying the JDA guidelines, especially point B, which gives examples of antisemitism in Israel and Palestine. The tweet seems to align with example 7: treating Jews (or Muslims here) as agents or responsible for a state's actions. Also, it supports example 9 by implying that Muslims are less loyal to their country than Jews.

Additionally, the tweet endorses harmful statements against Muslims, which falls under example 10 of denying rights or equality, albeit in reverse since it's about banning them from public office rather than outright denial.

So putting it all together, both parts of the tweet involve making comparisons and promoting negative stereotypes towards an entire group based on religion, which aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by JDA.

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) because it involves promoting harmful stereotypes and negative generalizations about Muslims. The comparison made between Muslims' current situation and Jews in Europe during a specific period highlights the use of stigmatization, which is a form of antisemitism as defined by JDA. Additionally, endorsing statements that call Islam a ""cancer"" and demand Muslim ban from public office exemplifies antisemitic behavior by promoting exclusionary views based on religion.

The tweet aligns with JDA's guidelines, particularly examples 7 and 9, which involve treating certain groups as responsible for state actions or agents of negative stereotypes. Furthermore, the endorsment of anti-Muslim statements directly opposes principles of equality and human rights, reinforcing antisemitic ideologies. Thus, both parts of the tweet reflect behaviors consistent with antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This reflects antisemitic behavior as it discriminates against Jewish individuals based on their association with specific actions (attending funerals) while ignoring similar actions taken by non-Jews.",No,"The tweet addresses a specific incident where Mayor DeZero denied Jews attendance at a funeral and allowed rioters and looters into the park. While this constitutes discrimination against Jews in that particular context, antisemitism as defined by JDA requires systemic or widespread discrimination or prejudice.

While not explicitly stating hatred or stereotypes, the context implies a judgment on a region's anti-Semitism that may reflect bias against Jewish people. This aligns with IHRA's definition where antisemitism includes acts that stigmatize or discriminate against Jews.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition of Antisemitism:** IHRA defines antisemitism as hatred toward Jews, expressed through speech, writing, actions, etc., targeting individuals or groups perceived as Jewish.

2. **Analysis of the Tweet Content:** The tweet requests a list of Jews in Kolomyya and comments on anti-Semitism's underrepresentation in Western media. It implies that Ukrainian anti-Semitism is not widely recognized.

3. **Application of Antisemitic Criteria:**
   - **Targeting Communities:** Asking for a list of Jews targets a specific community, which can perpetuate negative perceptions.
   - **Judgment on a Region:** The tweet's statement about anti-Semitism in Ukraine getting attention elsewhere could reflect bias against Jewish people, fitting the ""conspiracy"" and stigmatization aspects.

4. **Conclusion:** The tweet uses context to imply discrimination or judgment against Jews, thus aligning with IHRA's antisemitic criteria.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

Firstly, it reports on a specific incident where a Ukrainian police official requested a list of Jews in Kolomyya, Ukraine. This is an individual action and not a broader stereotype or prejudice.

Secondly, the tweet mentions that anti-Semitism in Ukraine receives little attention in the west but does not provide any evidence of discrimination based on race or perpetuate any antisemitic stereotypes. It simply points out a lack of media coverage without engaging in any discriminatory behavior or spreading false information about Jews.

According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves essentializing populations, using symbols tied to evil, or manifesting it in words, images, or deeds. The tweet does not fit these categories as it is factual reporting and does not exhibit any form of discrimination based on race. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic."

The tweet states that ""Jerusalem will be conquered, Jews will be wiped out,"" which implies a hatred towards Jews and their potential persecution. According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, this constitutes a perception or expression directed at Jewish individuals based on their identity. The tweet aligns with the criteria for antisemitic content as it expresses a negative stereotype that could be used to incite harm against Jews, fitting within the broader context of promoting antisemitic ideologies and potentially inciting hatred or discrimination.",Yes,"The tweet contains a statement by Nurettin Yldz that suggests Jerusalem will be conquered and Jews will be wiped out.

**Final Answer:**  
DECISION: Yes"
1300143863860834304,mdaleembasha,2020-08-30 18:50:27+00:00,0,Jews,RT @ashoswai: The Association of German National Jews (Verband nationaldeutscher Juden) had also supported Adolf Hitler.,No,"The tweet is a factual statement about the historical involvement of an organization in supporting Nazi actions. It does not express hate speech, incitement to hatred, or systemic discrimination against Jewish people according to IHRA's definition. While it refers to a past event contributing to antisemitism, it doesn't meet the criteria for being antisemitic itself.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet associates the Verband nationaldeutcher Juden with supporting Adolf Hitler, which ties their Jewish identity to a historical anti-Semitic act. This links the group collectively to an action that targets Jews, fitting under JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination or hostility based on Jewish identity.

The tweet employs a form of coded language where supporting Hitler is linked to Jewish heritage, capitalizing on a historical association for anti-Semitic purposes. This practice falls under JDA guideline 7, which states that treating Jews collectively as agents of a negative stereotype tied to their identity constitutes antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet's association of the group with Hitler's actions, despite being a broader critique not directly tied to the JDA's primary focus on Israel and Palestine, still qualifies as antisemitic.

Additionally, the tweet doesn't shy away from historical context but uses it in a way that reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews. There is no indication that the tweet is part of an approved viewpoint or supports non-antisemitic actions; instead, it perpetuates a harmful stereotype by linking Jewish identity to Hitler's anti-Semitic policies."

While it may target Jews in a joking manner, it doesn't explicitly exhibit hatred or negative stereotypes towards them as defined by IHRA. Instead, it appears more like a humorous comment rather than an antisemitic act.",Yes,"The tweet utilizes stereotypical imagery by associating Jews with Donald Trump, promoting a negative stereotype often used in antisemitic contexts. It equates Jewish people's support for Trump with exclusionary biases, reducing them to a generalized image rather than individuals with diverse beliefs and actions. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines, particularly its emphasis on essentializing groups and using stereotypes tied to evil or harmful narratives about Jews. Additionally, the tweet's suggestion that Jews have less right to pray for or support Trump compared to Christians further reinforces antisemitic views by devaluing Jewish contributions and marginalizing them in public discourse."

Additionally, the use of a swastika and the label ""Death to Jews"" reflects anti-Semitic imagery that targets an entire ethnic group based on its members' actions or characteristics.
