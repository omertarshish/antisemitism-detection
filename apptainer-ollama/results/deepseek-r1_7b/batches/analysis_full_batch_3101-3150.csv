It's so annoying how they change the term just what they want it to stand for and actually believe what they're spreading all across the Internet.",No,"The tweet in question critiques the use of the term ""Zionism"" by others, suggesting only Jews can define it and implying a power imbalance where non-Jews lack authority over its meaning. While this could touch on broader antisemitic themes like identity and self-determination, the tweet itself does not explicitly hate Jews or attack specific Jewish individuals or institutions. It uses the term to critique someone's perspective rather than targeting them personally or through symbols of antisemitism. Therefore, it doesn't meet all IHRA criteria without additional context indicating discriminatory intent against Jews as a group.

DECISION: No",Yes,"The tweet is indeed antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet questions whether non-Jews can define ""Zionism"" and asserts that only Jews should have this authority. This statement aligns with section B.1 of the JDA, which prohibits applying negative stereotypes or reifications tied to Jewish identity to the State of Israel. By suggesting that only Jews define Zionism, the tweet essentializes the concept as inherently tied to Jewishness, contributing to antisemitic practices. Additionally, the criticism of ""changing the term"" and spreading it without justification reflects a form of stigmatization against non-Jews for using or appropriating the term in ways perceived as antisemitic.

This use of language reinforces outdated stereotypes about Jews controlling cultural terms like Zionism, thereby contributing to antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

There are no elements suggesting targeting of Jewish individuals or groups with hate, discrimination, or negative stereotypes. The message is positive, inclusive, and avoids any antisemitic content as defined by IHRA.

---

The IHRA's working definition of antisemitism includes expressions that target Jewish individuals or communities, using hate speech, symbols, or stereotypes. In this case, the tweet is a general holiday greeting without targeting specific Jewish groups or employing negative stereotypes. It promotes well-being and is not indicative of antisemitic behavior.

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet does not contain any elements of antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It is a friendly greeting expressing good wishes to Jews around the world. The message focuses on positivity, health, and well-being without engaging in any discriminatory or hostile behavior towards Jews. It adheres to JDA principles by avoiding essentialization, coded language associated with antisemitic stereotypes, and maintaining a non-aggressive tone."

It labels discussion about Jews as antisemitic, which could perpetuate a negative stereotype. Additionally, it mocks other groups in ways that could be homophobic or racist, uses humor referencing a prophet typically stereotypically associated with Jews, and generalizes freedom to include offending specific groups. Each of these tactics aligns with IHRA's definition by creating a negative perception directed toward Jewish individuals or communities.

The tweet's statements about freedom and offencing others can also be misused to justify discrimination against Jews, which is another antisemitic tactic. While the context in which ""prophet"" is used might generally refer to respected prophets from other cultures, its use here likely refers to a stereotype associated with Jews, thus fitting the definition of antisemitism.

Overall, each element of the tweet contributes to its classification as antisemitic under IHRA's working definition.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with the definition and guidelines of antisemitism as outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Categorization and Essentialization**: The tweet categorically labels any mention of Jews as anti-Semitic, which falls under essentializing a group based on their identity.

2. **Stereotyping and Generalization**: By referring to Jews in a broad, negative manner without considering individual actions or context, the tweet uses stereotypes that generalize an entire group, a key aspect of antisemitism.

3. **Denigration of Other Groups for Contextual Comparison**: The use of comparable labels towards other groups (e.g., criticizing gays and colored people) reflects a pattern that could be applied to Jews, reinforcing harmful categorization.

4. **Lack of Contextual Justification**: The tweet does not provide a valid reason or context for treating Jews as anti-Semitic, which is problematic when essentializing an entire group based on prejudice without evidence.

5. **Distinction Between Freedom and Antisemitism**: While the user distinguishes between freedom and anti-Semitism in their message, the categorical approach to Jews still constitutes harm by reinforcing negative stereotypes and patterns of discrimination.

According to the JDA's guidelines, these actions indicate antisemitism due to essentializing an entire group based on prejudice rather than individual or contextual facts."

It employs broad statements without specific context or evidence, aligning with antisemitic tropes of portraying an entire group negatively. This qualifies it as antisemitic under the IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet employs language that essentializes Jewish people by generalizing their hardships without considering individual circumstances. It uses emotionally charged and stereotypical language (e.g., ""jews had to sacrifice"") which can reinforce anti-Semitic stereotypes, treating Jews as a homogeneous group with negative traits. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines on essentialization and reinforcing harmful narratives about Jewish identity and resilience."

By comparing them to someone else in a way that implies a lack of boldness or knowledge, the tweet may contribute to negative stereotypes and antisemitism according to the IHRA's definition.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as including expressions directed toward Jewish individuals or groups through rhetoric, physical actions, or discrimination. While the tweet doesn't explicitly name specific individuals or directly accuse Jews, it uses a comparison that could be seen as dehumanizing and perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jewish people. This aligns with the concept of using stigmatizing language to characterize a group negatively, which can contribute to antisemitism.

However, the use of ""@IMTIzonism"" might have been intentional to mock or stereotype Jews, but it's important to note that even unintentional offensives can be evaluated within legal and ethical standards regarding antisemitism. In this case, the tweet does not explicitly violate any legal prohibitions against antisemitic acts, such as distributing materials denying the Holocaust or causing harm, but it still falls under the category of expressing negative stereotypes through language comparison.

In summary, while the tweet doesn't directly accuse Jews of harm or use explicit discriminatory terms, its nature and intent align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by using language that could perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jewish people.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It makes a positive statement about Kedar Mordechai, expressing admiration for his boldness and knowledge. There is no reference to essentializing Jews or promoting harmful stereotypes such as equating them with evil forces. The tweet does not attack specific groups or use any of the guidelines outlined in JDA that define antisemitism. It focuses on a compliment to an individual rather than any population, thus avoiding antisemitic content."

The IHRA definition focuses on directed hatred or perception toward Jewish individuals or groups based on their identity, religion, or ethnicity.

The tweet draws an inappropriate parallel between two distinct groups: political support and Nazi ideology, reinforcing the stereotype that Jews are complicit in harm caused by Hitler. This aligns with IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes using sinister stereotypes to target Jews. While not explicitly harmful in action but harmful in perception, it still fits the definition due to its discriminatory tone and reliance on a negative stereotype.

Additionally, the tweet may be seen as aiding or justifying antisemitic behavior by associating support for Trump with anti-Semitic admiration of Hitler, potentially influencing others to view Jewish people negatively. This manipulation of stereotypes and harmful generalizations towards Jews meets the IHRA's standards for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

1. **Linking American Jews to Israelis**: The tweet suggests that American Jews are Israelis, which could be seen as stereotyping and essentializing a group based on geography. However, this connection might not be accurate or harmful in itself without additional context or evidence supporting it.

2. **Use of the Term ""Schmendrick""**: While ""schmendrick"" is a Yiddish term meaning ""screw-up,"" its use here does not inherently carry antisemitic connotations unless it is used to imply negative stereotypes about Jews.

3. **Lack of Evidence or Context**: The tweet makes a sweeping generalization without providing evidence or context, but this in itself does not constitute antisemitism if the statement is factually accurate and not based on prejudice.

4. **Societal Connotations**: Associating American Jews with Israelis could be part of broader stereotypes about Jewish peoplehood, which might contribute to antisemitism if it reinforces negative ideas without proper evidence or context.

The subsequent part of the tweet expresses a commitment to speaking out against anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms, which is a broader statement about society's response to such issues rather than any specific targeting of Jewish people. 

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination directed specifically at Jews, but here, the tweet does not singling out or essentialize any group beyond their role as victims of Nazism. There are no references to Israel/Palestine, nor is there any portrayal of Jews as agents of evil or part of a hostile state. The language used is neutral and inclusive, focusing on justice and human rights without any targeted remarks against Jewish individuals or communities.

Furthermore, the JDA emphasizes that it's not antisemitic to criticize Israel/Palestine in ways that aim for equality among all inhabitants of the region.

According to the IHRA's definition, antisemitism includes targeting specific communities based on race or ethnicity within the context of Jewish identity. The use of such a term perpetuates harmful stereotypes that can marginalize and harm Black Jews. Additionally, the tweet employs pejorative language towards them by suggesting frustration without addressing their concerns or acknowledging their existence, which contributes to antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA. Therefore, the tweet does not adhere to antisemitism standards but instead engages in practices that can exacerbate discrimination against a specific group.",No,"The tweet does not directly address or target Jews as Jews but refers to ""Jews of color,"" which essentializes Jewish identity based on skin color.

By singling out another person and then shifting blame to the state of Israel, it extends criticism beyond individual Jews, thereby associating the group with negative stereotypes or actions. This form of stereotyping and indirect targeting aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

The tweet's approach is akin to accusing a people (Jews) of wrongdoing while focusing on a state that is often stereotypically linked to them. This practice uses a double standard, treating individuals differently than the state, which is another hallmark of antisemitism. Thus, it fits within the category of antisemitic acts through stereotyping and indirect targeting.",No,"The tweet in question shifts the blame from Jews to Israel, suggesting that anti-Semitic views are directed at the state rather than the individuals within it. According to the Jerusalem Declaration, antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as people or through representations linking them to evil. This tweet does not directly target Jews but instead redirects criticism to Israel's actions. It avoids the use of coded language and broad generalizations typical of antisemitism, focusing instead on political accusations without affirmatively targeting Jews.

1. **Targeting Jews**: The tweet refers to ""Jews"" in a neutral manner, describing them as targets without any overtly antisemitic language or stereotypes.

2. **Political Context**: The tweet attributes the actions of law enforcement towards Jews to a political figure, a Governor, but does not imply that this individual supports antisemitism. It is more about a political accusation rather than an act of hatred or discrimination against Jews.

3. **Lack of Stereotypes or Denial**: There is no mention of any conspiracies, denial of the Holocaust, or use of negative stereotypes related to Jews. The tweet does not deny Jewish rights or responsibility for historical events like the Holocaust.

4. **Contextual Accusation**: The tweet's focus is on law enforcement and governance rather than accusing a group based on religion, ethnicity, or ideology beyond that specific context.

Since none of these elements align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which requires directed hatred, stereotyping, or denial of significant historical events against Jews, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet mentions that police are using force ""this way"" against the Jews in New York and notes that this action is directed by a liberal Democrat Governor. While the mention of the Governor's party affiliation does not directly target Jews but could imply an association with a political group, it might stretch the intended link between the Governor's party and antisemitic police actions. Under the JDA, pointing out a political leader's party without specific targeting is protected speech under guideline 14. However, if there's an implied connection implying that Democrats are involved in antisemitic acts against Jews, this could be seen as stretching beyond acceptable boundaries, making it potentially antisemitic."

This aligns with JDA guidelines where associating a group (in this case, Jews) with oppressive regimes can be seen as antisemitic.

The tweet's support for Hitler's perceived success in the economy, even if it doesn't acknowledge his negative policies, could imply support for actions that are harmful to others and problematic from a Jewish perspective. Thus, it touches on the problematic area of associating a group with oppressive practices without explicitly condemning them, making it antisemitic according to JDA standards."

There is no indication of antisemitic content as defined by IHRA, which requires targeting Jews specifically for their Jewishness with hate or criticism.",No,"The tweet argues that supporting Zionism is essential for protecting Jews from antisemitism and ensures their right to a safe home in Israel. It implies that not supporting Zionism means denying Jewish rights, which ties the state's actions (through Zionism) directly to the protection of Jews. While it doesn't use essentializing language explicitly, it reinforces harmful stereotypes by associating Zionism with Jewish safety and rights, potentially influencing negative perceptions of Jews if taken out of context. Thus, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not inherently antisemitic but could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes when viewed in light of its content."

Never Again.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by IHRA. It honors Holocaust Remembrance Day by acknowledging victims, including Jews, and calls for an end to anti-Semitism and related forms of hatred. This statement is about confronting and combating antisemitic attitudes rather than perpetuating them or supporting harmful stereotypes directed specifically at Jewish individuals or groups.

The tweet's purpose is to promote remembrance and oppose hate, which falls outside the scope of antisemitism as it involves addressing and opposing negative behaviors, not engaging in any form of discriminatory speech or actions.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It honors the victims of Nazism with a focus on remembrance and opposes anti-Semitism. There are no instances where Jews are linked to evil or forces of hatred beyond the context of Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is appropriate for such occasions. The tweet respects victims without employing any antisemitic symbols or stereotypes.

The tweet correctly addresses anti-Semitism by speaking out against it in all forms but does not engage in any form of discrimination, prejudice, or stigmatization directed at Jews. It serves to educate and honor victims, aligning with the principles of respecting victims and opposing hatred rather than trivializing or attacking them through antisemitic means.

Thus, the tweet is not antisemitic as it falls within acceptable forms of expression and criticism without involving any harmful stereotypes or references typical of antisemitism."

It is a rhetorical question aimed at someone for starting a sentence about Jews without expressing hatred, making negative generalizations, or using stereotypical language. There's no indication of targeting Jews based on their identity or promoting harmful stereotypes.

The tweet simply poses a question to someone else regarding how they start sentences about Jews, without engaging in any antisemitic speech or behavior.",No,"The tweet in question is ""@shirahana"" and ""@shirahanau and why would anyone start a sentence with 'Jews believe'?"" Upon analysis, the second part of the tweet suggests that someone starts a sentence with ""Jews believe,"" implying a stereotype about Jews. However, without context, it's difficult to definitively label this as antisemitic. The JDA emphasizes that making generalizations or essentializing any population can be racist, and here it's suggested that all Jews share a certain belief. This aligns with the principle of essentialization (guideline 1), which could constitute antisemitism. However, without more context, such as what ""Jews believe"" refers to, it's unclear if this constitutes full-blown antisemitism. Therefore, while there are tendencies towards antisemitic elements, it doesn't conclusively meet the criteria based on the given information."
