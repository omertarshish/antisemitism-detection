Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as per IHRA's definition.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's read the tweet again:

""Every time the SA-Indian question comes up, I always think about how the Irish became white (vs how the Jews became white) in the US.\nIndians in SA pursued the same approach as the Irish of 'we are not like the nigg**s' but drawing differences between them and the k*ff*rs.""

Alright, so the user is comparing two different groups: Irish Americans and Jewish Americans. They're talking about how both groups have faced issues with their identity formation in America. Specifically, they mention that Indians in South Africa (SA) are being questioned, similar to how Jews were treated.

Looking at the tweet's content, it seems to compare two minority groups from different backgrounds. The user is highlighting similarities and differences between how these groups perceive themselves compared to other groups, particularly focusing on a term like ""nigg**s,"" which is derogatory.

Now, applying the JDA guidelines:

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: It's discrimination or prejudice against Jews as Jews. So, if someone generalizes about Jews in any way that's harmful, it could be antisemitic.

2. **General Guidelines**:
   - Point 1: Essentializing or making broad negative generalizations is a form of racism.
   - Point 2: Linking Jews to evil, which this tweet does implicitly by comparing them to others who are viewed negatively (like ""nigg**s"").
   - Point 3: Antisemitism can manifest in words and deeds. The tweet uses derogatory language (""nigg**s"") directed at a group, which could be considered antisemitic.
   - Point 4: It's coded speech if context isn't considered, but here the user is directly using the term ""nigg**s"" without context, making it more explicit.

3. **Application to Tweet**: The tweet uses derogatory language directed at a group (Jews) by comparing them to another negative perception of others. This could be seen as essentializing Jews or using coded language based on their Jewish identity.

4. **Guidelines 6-15**: These deal with Israel and Palestine, but the tweet doesn't reference these points directly since it's focusing on comparisons rather than state policies.

So, considering that the tweet uses derogatory terms towards a group (Jews) by analogy to how others are perceived, it touches on the essence of antisemitism as defined. The user is making generalizations and using negative stereotypes about Jews, which falls under point 2 and 3 of the JDA guidelines.

Therefore, yes, this tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA because it uses derogatory language directed at Jews by analogy to how other groups are perceived.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines. The tweet employs derogatory language (""nigg**s"") to make generalizations about Jews, drawing an analogy to how other negatively perceived groups (like those referred to as ""k*ff*rs""). This use of coded or generalized language aligns with JDA's definition and guidelines, particularly regarding essentializing a population based on their identity."

1. **Essentialization and Generalization**: The tweet generalizes Black Jews into a broad category, essentializing their collective experience of racism within the community. This aligns with guideline 1, which warns against making sweeping negative generalizations.

2. **Coded Speech and Antisemitism**: Tema uses coded language to imply that Black Jews are responsible for the community's racial issues. This reflects a broader antisemitic narrative where certain groups are scapegoated, fitting within the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

3. **Scapegoating and Hostility**: The tweet includes claims that people in his community are ""victim blamed"" and facing attacks due to racism. This aligns with guidelines 7 and 8, where individuals are treated as agents of a larger negative force (antisemitism) without justification.

4. **Criticizing Without Justification**: Tema criticizes the Black community without providing factual basis or constructive dialogue, which is problematic in discussions about sensitive topics like antisemitism.

In summary, the tweet employs essentialization, coded speech, scapegoating, and blanket criticism, all of which are consistent with the JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition Check:** The IHRA defines antisemitism as hatred or negative perceptions toward Jews, including speech, actions, etc., based on Jewish identity.
   
2. **Content Analysis:** The tweet commends Indian Jews for maintaining Jewish tradition and singing ""HaTikva."" It's a positive recognition of their cultural preservation.

3. **Absence of Hatred:** There are no hostile or negative references to Jews, aligning with the IHRA's criteria.

4. **Cultural Respect:** The tweet respects the identity of Indian Jews as a distinct group within their cultural context.

5. **Conclusion:** Since there's no antisemitic content, the tweet is not classified as such under IHRA guidelines.",No,"The tweet in question states that Indian Jews from the Bnei Menashe tribe are singing Israel's national anthem ""HaTikva"" and expresses a positive sentiment towards this action.

This tweet does not target Jews negatively; it simply celebrates the cultural tradition of Indian Jews performing Israel's anthem. It avoids making broad generalizations or using negative stereotypes about Jewish people. The statement is neutral and does not imply any form of discrimination or hostile intent towards any group of Jews, including Indian ones. Therefore, this tweet is not antisemitic as per the JDA guidelines."

Okay, I need to determine whether the provided tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's recall the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. It involves a perception or expression of hatred toward Jews, both in terms of speech, writing, actions, and visual forms. The examples given include calling for harm to Jews, making dehumanizing claims about their collective power, accusing them of conspiracies or wrongdoing, denial of historical atrocities, etc.

Now, looking at the tweet: ""Go and consult a copy of the Torah for what it teaches ALL of us Jews. Urgently. In the case of the worst culprits on here, I've never come across such a bunch of disgusting hypocrites in my life.""

The tweet is directed at someone referred to as ""the worst culprits on here,"" and the person criticizes them by calling them ""disgusting hypocrites."" The use of ""Jews"" is mentioned towards the end when referring to the culprits.

Breaking it down: The user accuses others of hypocrisy, which can be seen as a negative stereotype. Hypocrisy often carries a negative connotation in antisemitic contexts because it implies that Jews are moral or virtuous but act unethically. However, the IHRA definition emphasizes that such expressions must target specific groups and not just any group.

In this case, the tweet is directed at individuals on a platform (probably Twitter) who may be considered problematic. The use of ""Jews"" as a term of exclusion and stigmatization could fit within the antisemitic framework. However, it's important to consider whether the reference to Jews is specific enough or if it's part of a broader critique.

The tweet also includes a call to consult the Torah for what it teaches Jews, which might be interpreted as promoting Jewish teachings without addressing any negative behavior. The hypocrite comment could be seen as accusing others of moral failing while associating with a group that has a history of persecution, which could be considered hypocritical and thus antisemitic.

However, the IHRA definition allows for expressions directed toward specific groups (like Jews) as long as they meet other criteria. So, while the tweet might contain elements of antisemitism through stigmatization and hypocrisy, it's important to assess if this aligns with the IHRA's operational definition, which includes both speech and behavior directed at specific groups.

Another angle is whether the criticism applies specifically to Jews or just broadly to individuals on the platform. If it's the latter, then it might not meet the criteria of antisemitism as defined by IHRA because it doesn't target a specific group but rather a broader category with an exclusion label (Jews).

In conclusion, while the tweet contains some elements that could align with antisemitic definitions, especially through stigmatization and hypocrisy directed toward Jews, the specificity and context are crucial. If the criticism is solely about others on the platform without targeting a specific Jewish group beyond their membership in that community, it might not fully meet IHRA's criteria. However, if the reference to ""Jews"" is meant to label them as hypocrites regardless of other contexts, then it could be considered antisemitic.

But wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The tweet does explicitly mention ""Jews"" in a negative context (""hypocrites"") and refers to consulting the Torah for their teachings (implying Jewish teachings). So that's specific enough. Therefore, according to IHRA, this could be considered antisemitic because it makes a negative stereotype about Jews.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it contains elements of stigmatization and hypocrisy directed specifically at a group (Jews). The use of ""hypocrites"" toward others while implicitly associating them with Jewish stereotypes fits within the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes expressions targeting specific groups with negative connotations.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic because it does not meet any criteria outlined in the JDA. Here's why:

1. **Generalization about the Torah**: The statement ""ALL of us Jews"" essentializes all Jews, which violates guideline 1 by making broad generalizations without context or diversity.

2. **Stereotyping as hypocrites**: Labeling someone as a hypocrite is a stereotype (guideline 3), and it's used here to judge people's actions without justification, potentially implying they are acting against their Jewishness.

Given that the tweet uses generalizations and stereotyping without providing evidence or context, it does not align with antisemitic practices."

4. **Non-Harmful Context**: The mention of the Holocaust is used more as a general reference to atrocities against Jews rather than making any direct link to antisemitism, which could be seen as an oversimplification but not inherently harmful.

Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. The tweet says Sharpton called cops ""pigs,"" whites ""interlopers,"" Greeks ""homos,"" and Jews ""diamond merchants."" 

First, looking at the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves targeting or expressing hatred toward Jews in various forms: speech, writing, actions, etc., using negative stereotypes.

Sharpton's comments directly label Jews as ""diamond merchants,"" which is a derogatory stereotype. This fits because it uses a negative trait (merchant) to define Jews negatively. Also, the tweet is directed specifically at Jews among other groups like cops and Greeks, which aligns with targeting Jewish individuals or communities.

Additionally, the tweet uses a form of antisemitic speech by categorizing Jews in a way that's meant to stereotype them negatively. This matches IHRA's criteria for expressions aimed at causing hatred or discrimination against Jews.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it uses derogatory language and negative stereotypes to target Jews. Specifically, Sharpton refers to Jews as ""diamond merchants,"" which employs a negative stereotype. This matches the IHRA criteria for antisemitism, which includes using negative character traits or stereotypes against Jews in speech. The tweet's overtly hateful remarks toward Jews fit within the defined categories of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that directly opposes a specific characterization of Jewish people, notably through the term ""Jews 'diamond merchants',"" which is an explicit anti-Semitic stereotype equating Jews with wealth and commerce. This goes beyond mere derogatory remarks about other groups like cops or Greeks to target Jewish individuals specifically, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews."

The tweet does not reference any historical events (like Jo Cox or Hillsborough) that could be misconstrued as implying moral superiority or antisemitism towards Jews.

While the context suggests a focus on radical protest against what is perceived as targeting Jews, the IHRA definition emphasizes that antisemitism involves targeting or perceiving Jews in a way that is hostile. However, since there's no explicit mention of Jews being targeted or attacked, and the tweet does not directly express hatred or discrimination towards them, it may not fully meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

The IHRA definition requires more than just association; it involves direct or indirect targeting with overtly hostile expressions. Without specific references to Jews or their communities being targeted, the tweet falls short of constituting antisemitic behavior according to the given standards.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet presents a scenario where radical protesters are depicted as chanting about ""killing Jews,"" which directly associates them with antisemitic actions. However, the tweet is more of a commentary or critique on media reporting rather than making a direct claim about the actions of Jews. It does not use the term ""Jewish"" in an ethnic context but refers to them as part of a broader narrative about antisemitism. Additionally, the tweet's focus is on the portrayal of media bias without explicitly engaging with the JDA's guidelines for what constitutes antisemitic language or behavior.

The key issue here is that while the tweet contains loaded language and stereotyping by associating protesters with ""killing Jews,"" it does not directly target or generalize about Jews as a group, which would be antisemitic. Instead, it uses the term to describe the actions of a segment of the population, which may be seen as an opinion rather than explicitly antisemitic speech."

However, the tweet conflates the legitimate concerns about violence against a political opposition group with harmful stereotypes, which raises ethical concerns but not to the extent of being antisemitic under IHRA's definition.

The tweet employs a false and offensive stereotype by labeling Biafrans as Jews or Christians, which is a significant misrepresentation.

The tweet employs several mechanisms outlined in the JDA as tools for antisemitism. Firstly, it equates the speaker's behavior towards Jews with that of Adolf Hitler through coded language (""I'm not hating them...

Additionally, the tweet uses stereotyping by associating the speaker as a neutral person (who doesn't hate Jews) with a known anti-Semite, thereby reinforcing negative perceptions of Jews through positive reinforcement (comparing oneself to a harmful figure).

Furthermore, the tweet employs coded speech without context, where the phrase ""I'm not hating them"" is used as a positive statement while implying support for Hitler's actions. This manipulation of language and stereotypes is in line with guidelines 3 and 4 of the JDA.

Lastly, by supporting anti-Semitic views (like Hitler) and downplaying or justifying them, the speaker engages in behavior outlined in guideline 5, potentially denying or minimizing the severity of antisemitism.

This conclusion stems from several JDA guidelines. Firstly, under guideline 6, applying symbols or stereotypes to a group can perpetuate negative generalizations. The reference to Hitler's Germany ties into historical antisemitism, using imagery associated with Jews to associate University students in that context, which aligns with the stereotype application aspect of antisemitism. Additionally, under guideline 7, treating these students as part of a problematic category (Jews) without promoting equality or justice touches on the theme of discrimination and prejudice against Jewish individuals based on historical associations. Thus, the tweet perpetuates negative stereotypes and aligns with JDA's definition by highlighting past discriminatory treatment tied to Jews in a specific historical context."

While the tweet could be interpreted as targeting individuals and making broad statements about a community without explicit intent, the mention of Jews could lead to stereotyping or negative assumptions about their voting habits or behavior. This aligns with the IHRA definition, which includes using stereotypes or negative character traits directed at a specific group based on nationality. Therefore, while not explicitly accusing Jews of an action, the tweet may be seen as antisemitic due to its potential implications and context suggesting stereotyping.",Yes,"The tweet uses stereotypical language that associates Jews with people who don't vote their way, implying they are being treated unjustly. This practice of stereotyping and attacking a group based on specific characteristics (voting behavior) is consistent with antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It involves essentializing Jews by associating them with negative stereotypes, which is harmful and discriminative.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Nature of the Content:** The tweet uses language directed at individuals, specifically referring to ""his fellow Jews"" who don't vote a certain way. This implies a stereotype or generalization about Jews based on their voting behavior.

3. **Stereotyping and Hostility:** The use of terms like ""jerk"" and the targeting of Jews by their characteristics (voting) is a form of hostile and discriminatory speech that Essentializes Jewish identity, fitting the JDA's criteria for antisemitism.

4. **Conclusion:** The tweet exhibits antisemitic behavior by using stereotypical language to judge individuals based on their voting habits, thereby discriminat against Jewish people."

I’ve just had people tell me that nazis aren’t “about Jews anymore” when they very much are, and it’s just scary to be forgotten as one of their main targets when groups of them come together. But ofc you’re totally right.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews with hate speech or use negative stereotypes about them. It discusses Nazism in a general context and the perception of it changing over time, without specific references to antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

The author addresses individuals with a specific handle related to ""jewish_bisexual"" and expresses a concern about Nazism's perceived shift away from targeting Jews, suggesting that while they are still targeted as a group, there is fear of being forgotten. This statement does not engage in any form of antisemitic behavior such as essentializing Jews, using harmful stereotypes, or attacking Israel/Palestine. Instead, it reflects a personal concern without invoking any of the explicit antisemitic examples provided, such as targeting Israel, engaging with historical denial, or using coded language that associates Jews with evil.

This tweet is more of a critical comment without fulfilling the necessary elements of antisemitic behavior outlined by the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet makes a categorical statement linking Jews' prosperity with a lack of empathy, which essentializes the group based on economic status.

Antisemitism typically involves targeting specific Jewish individuals or groups, whereas this tweet focuses on their political supporters without singling them out as Jews.
