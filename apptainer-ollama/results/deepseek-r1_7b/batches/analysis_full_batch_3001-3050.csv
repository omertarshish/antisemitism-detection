It associates Jews with a broader group of haters, suggesting they are part of a community that hates liberals and other groups. This spreads harmful stereotypes about Jews, fitting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by targeting negative traits towards them through speech and categorization.

DECISION: Yes",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet associates Fox News with a collective hatred of various groups, including Jews, by suggesting that people who hate these groups are part of Fox News' community and pretend to hate liberals. This aligns with JDA's guidelines as it essentializes Jews into a broader stereotype, lumping them in with other haters without considering their unique identity. Additionally, the tweet implies that Jews are collectively responsible for negative actions, which is another antisemitic theme. The mention of Fox News as a space for hatred against multiple groups further marginalizes Jews and aligns with antisemitic practices of erasure and stigmatization."

However, according to the IHRA definition, antisemitism is specifically directed at Jews themselves, not necessarily at their allies or opponents. While the tweet could be interpreted as implying that Marxists hate Jews, it does not directly target Jews but rather associates them with a negative stereotype. Therefore, under the IHRA's criteria, this tweet may not qualify as antisemitic because it does not directly manifest hatred towards Jews or their institutions.",Yes,"The tweet employs coded language by associating the ""antiracism movement"" with Marxists who are implied to hate Jews. This falls under section 2 of the JDA, which warns against essentializing or generalizing about a population. By linking the movement to a political ideology and suggesting it hates Jews, the tweet uses coded speech that could imply anti-Semitic hatred without directly referencing Jews as inherently evil. This qualifies as antisemitic as per the JDA's guidelines."

According to IHRA, antisemitism involves directing hatred toward specific Jewish individuals or groups based on negative stereotypes. By singling out British Jews and implying they are responsible for the atrocities, the tweet employs a form of antisemitic criticism that associates blame with a particular Jewish identity.

This action aligns with the IHRA's definition as it expresses a negative stereotype directed at a specific subgroup within the broader Jewish community, which is a recognized form of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet contains both a correct assessment and a problematic statement:

1. **Criticizing Israeli military atrocities**: This is acceptable because it does not involve targeting specific Jewish individuals or groups but rather addressing the actions of a state.

2. **Holding British Jews accountable for Israeli atrocities**: This could be considered antisemitic as it imposes a negative stereotype on all British Jews based on their heritage, potentially implying loyalty to Israel over their own countries (as per point 9 in the JDA guidelines). While the tweet's intention may not be malicious, it risks stereotyping and thus aligning with the definition of antisemitism."

Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet says ""@jewish_activist Now Jews are so polarized from other Jews :( As an unapologetic Zionist, I don‚Äôt think antizionist Jews are ‚Äúbad‚Äù tho I think often their minds have been colonized in some ways by goy society &amp; I think they were taught a very ashkenormative view of Jewish history"". 

First, I'll break down the tweet. The user refers to ""antizionist Jews"" as not being ""bad."" They also mention that these Jews are colonized and taught an ""ashkenormative"" view of Jewish history by ""goy society,"" which is a term for non-Jews or gentiles.

Looking at the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. The tweet seems to be criticizing Jews by labeling them as colonized and culturally assimilated. This could imply that their views are influenced negatively by external forces (goy society), which aligns with point B6: applying negative stereotypes about Jews.

Also, the tweet is making generalizations about all Jewish people without exception, which falls under point A1 about essentializing or making sweeping generalizations. Additionally, it's dismissing the idea that some Jews might have good intentions and could be ""bad"" individuals, which might be part of antisemitic judgment.

There's no mention of Holocaust denial here, so that guideline doesn't apply. The tweet seems to promote a form of cultural‰ºòË∂äÊÑü or elite status among Jews, which can perpetuate antisemitism by demonizing them as having been colonized and thus lacking intrinsic value.

So, putting it all together: the tweet is making broad generalizations about Jews, promoting stereotypes (colonized, ashkenormative history), and uses terms that imply some are ""bad"" while others aren't. Therefore, according to JDA guidelines, this tweet exhibits antisemitic elements.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet contains elements of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet generalizes about Jews by labeling them as colonized and culturally assimilated, which falls under the guidance that suggests making sweeping negative generalizations or essentializing a group. Additionally, the tweet dismisses the idea of some Jews being ""good"" while others are ""bad,"" which could perpetuate harmful judgments based on ethnicity rather than individual merit or character. Furthermore, the use of terms like ""colonized"" and ""ashkenormative view"" aligns with guidelines that criticize the association of Jews with negative stereotypes linked to external forces (Goy society). Thus, these actions constitute antisemitism according to JDA."

1. **General Definition**: Antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, or hostility against Jews based on their ethnicity.

2. **Avoidance of Denying Rights**: The tweet does not deny the right of Jews to exist or flourish in Israel, as per item 10 of the JDA guidelines.

3. **No Hidden Agenda or Stereotypes**: The statement about Jews being okay with alcohol and size does not use any antisemitic stereotypes or essentialize Jews into inherently negative traits tied to race or ethnicity.

4. **Non-Specific Claims**: The tweet does not attribute responsibility for Israel's conduct, nor does it make any statements about loyalty towards Israel versus other countries (item 9).

5. **Contextual Framing**: The statement is framed neutrally without supporting Palestinian rights or criticizing Zionism in a way that would be seen as biased against Jews.

Since the tweet lacks any elements of antisemitic discrimination and adheres to principles of neutrality, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the JDA's definition."

Additionally, it falsely accuses Israel of deporting Africans seeking asylum without basis in fact, while also addressing issues towards Palestinians, thus reinforcing antisemitic and discriminatory attitudes.",No,"The tweet does not directly mention or imply antisemitism.

It states that Orthodox Jews, as more visible members of the community, are likely to suffer anti-Semitic attacks. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes expressions of hatred or discrimination directed at Jewish individuals or groups based on their identity. By highlighting this stereotype and associating it with broader negative perceptions, the tweet contributes to a harmful generalization that targets Orthodox Jews as vulnerable to antisemitic attacks. This form of stereotyping reinforces negative perceptions about the Jewish community, thereby fitting within the IHRA's framework of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet is not inherently antisemitic. While it acknowledges the suffering of Orthodox Jews due to anti-Semitism, this assertion uses negative stereotypes about a specific Jewish subgroup without providing evidence or context. However, according to JDA guidelines, associating a group with suffering from anti-Semitism can be seen as stereotyping and thus contributes to potential antisemitism. The critique of Israeli actions is neutral unless it implies systematic discrimination against Jews, which isn't the case here.

Wait, upon re-evaluation, considering the use of Orthodox Jews as a stereotypical group being victims, this could be problematic under JDA's guidelines as it implies a negative stereotype about them. Therefore, the tweet might be considered antisemitic due to its potential association with harmful stereotypes and lack of acknowledgment of their contributions or equal treatment. 

But in the initial analysis, I concluded no because the critique itself wasn't directly antisemitic unless it implied systematic discrimination. The mention of Orthodox Jews is a problematic stereotype, but if the tweet doesn't provide evidence, maybe it's not yet antisemitic.

Wait, perhaps the correct decision is No, as the tweet does not explicitly use negative stereotypes beyond associating visibility with suffering, which can be viewed as stereotyping but may not reach antisemitism without more context. The focus should be on whether the content itself constitutes discrimination or bias.

After careful consideration, I'll stick with my initial conclusion: No, because while there are elements that could be seen as problematic, they don't fully meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism in this context."

First, it references religious texts that are often used to support anti-Semitic ideologies‚Äîsuch as the Old and New Testaments justifying genocide against non-Jews, and the Quran encouraging hatred of non-Muslims. These references can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jews by implying they are responsible for significant atrocities or promoting discrimination based on religion. Second, the tweet includes a comment suggesting that transgender individuals should be addressed by their biological gender, which could contribute to gender-based discrimination and reinforce negative stereotypes. While the tweet does not directly target Jews, its use of anti-Semitic justifications from religious texts and its overtly hostile remarks toward transgender people align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.

The tweet is antisemitic because it employs harmful generalizations about non-Jews based on religion and promotes discrimination against a specific group (transgender individuals) by suggesting they should be treated as men. These actions can lead to antisemitic behaviors, fitting within the IHRA's framework.",Yes,"The tweet is classified as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) because it references religious texts that justify and glorify acts of genocide against non-Jews, including Jews. Specifically:

1. The Old Testament's justification of genocide against non-Jews directly aligns with antisemitic ideologies.
2. The New Testament's encouragement of hatred toward Jews is a classic example of antisemitism as defined by the JDA.
3. The Quran's encouragement of hatred against non-Muslims also perpetuates systematic discrimination, which indirectly affects Jews.

While the fourth part of the tweet uses humor about gender stereotypes and doesn't directly target Jews, it does not negate the overall content that explicitly references and justifies harm toward non-Jews. Therefore, the presence of these elements makes the tweet antisemitic."

---

**Final Answer:**
DECISION: No",No,"The tweet indirectly associates a specific Jewish subgroup (Brooklyn Orthodox Jews) with COVID-19 cases. This targets a particular group of Jews, which falls under the definition of antisemitism as it involves discrimination against a specific population.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Content**: The tweet critiques Governor Cuomo's use of a photo to blame Brooklyn Orthodox Jews for an uptick in COVID-19.
2. **Targeted Group**: The tweet specifically names ""Brooklyn Orthodox Jews,"" targeting a particular Jewish subgroup with a negative stereotype.
3. **Application of Stereotypes**: By singling out Orthodox Jews, the tweet employs a stereotype that could be seen as discriminatory or harmful to this specific group.
4. **Guidelines Reference**: According to JDA guidelines (point 6 and 7), applying negative stereotypes or blaming a specific Jewish subgroup constitutes antisemitism.

While the tweet doesn't directly use antisemitic language but instead references a stereotypical label, it still violates antisemitism by targeting a specific Jewish population without context."

STILL? it's 5781 this is tired.,Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA's definition because it perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jewish people, asserting that they work to uphold white supremacy. This aligns with antisemitism as defined by targeting individuals based on negative perceptions and reinforcing harmful stereotypes.

The tweet uses pejorative language (""white jews"") and asserts a perception of Jews engaged in actions deemed anti-Semitic, which fits the IHRA's criteria for antisemitic behavior. It reflects a denial of critical historical facts about antisemitism and perpetuates harmful narratives about Jewish communities.",No,"The tweet contains elements that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly through its use of racialized language and problematic terminology. 

1. **Racialized Language**: The term ""white jews"" is offensive as it combines a racial descriptor (""white"") with a stigmatizing label for Jews. This usage essentializes Jewish people into negative stereotypes, which is a form of antisemitism.

2. **Questioning Antisemitic Claims**: While the tweet critiques the necessity of anti-Semitic claims, this critique itself can perpetuate harmful narratives if not carefully addressed. Essentializing groups to dismiss such claims may contribute to reinforcing negative perceptions of Jewish people.

3. **Offensive Terminology**: The phrase ""white jews"" is inherently problematic and offensive, as it conflates race with a group identity in a way that undermines respect for individuals and their contributions.

In conclusion, the tweet uses language and terminology that aligns with antisemitic practices by essentializing Jewish people into negative stereotypes. Therefore, according to the JDA's definition, the tweet is considered antisemitic."

This label associates him with negative characteristics based on his Jewish identity, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it involves rhetorical criticism or stigmatization of Jews through negative language.

The tweet's use of ""Fricking"" adds insult to injury by using slang, further perpetuating a harmful stereotype. While it doesn't directly target Israel, it employs a stereotypical label that reduces Sandler's professional accomplishments to his Jewish identity, aligning with antisemitic practices as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet ""That's My Boy!

While the term ""The King of Jews"" might suggest a positive recognition of Jewish heritage, it does so in an inappropriate context. The tweet does not engage in any form of discrimination or negative stereotype-making as defined by JDA guidelines.

The tweet focuses on an event involving the New York Jews for Trump caravan, which is unrelated to any form of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence directed at Jews as a group. The guidelines from the JDA emphasize that antisemitism involves essentializing groups, applying stereotypes, or making generalizations about Jewish people. Since this tweet does not involve such actions and instead describes an event without negative connotations, it is not classified as antisemitic.

Additionally, the tweet does not reference any historical cases of antisemitism, nor does it imply any form of discrimination based on race, religion, or ethnicity. The mention of ""Judaism"" alone does not carry any negative implications in this context and is used simply to identify the group involved.

In summary, there are no elements in the tweet that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. The use of ""Jews"" refers specifically to members of a political organization without any connotation of discrimination or prejudice against the broader Jewish population."

Specifically, it references synagogues being razed and mentions Igbo Jews being abducted. While the tweet does not directly accuse Jews or use negative stereotypes against them, the targeting of Jewish community institutions (synagogues) aligns with antisemitic actions as defined by IHRA, which includes directing physical harm towards Jewish properties or institutions.

Jews, Romans, Persians. Arabs. Same rule. They became active combatants in these wars.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews but stereotypically associates them with war service based on historical laws. While this may not directly engage the IHRA definition by attacking specific individuals, it perpetuates a stereotype that could be viewed as antisemitic if interpreted as equating Jewish identity with participation in armed conflict without proper context or nuance.

The tweet uses historical examples (Jews, Romans, Persians, Arabs) to justify war service at adulthood but does not explicitly distinguish between them and other groups. However, the stereotyping of Jews through this lens could be seen as conflating their identity with actions that are not universally applicable, which might align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving harmful stereotypes about Jewish people.

Therefore, while the tweet may not directly accuse Jews but uses a stereotype that could be deemed problematic by the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet discusses historical laws regarding war participation but does not explicitly or derogatorily target Jews. While it mentions ""Jews"" alongside other groups like Muslims and Romans, this inclusion could be interpreted as implying a link between Jewish identity and these actions without overtly antisemitic language. Therefore, it doesn't meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism in this context."

It uses a negative statement about two entities without specific antisemitic content, such as denying facts or accusing the ""jews lobby"" of controlling events. Therefore, it does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with the definition of antisemitism as outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Negative Stereotypes and Equitable Treatment**: The tweet equates both parties involved (""equally evil for rest of world"") and attributes their actions to a ""jews lobby,"" which is a negative stereotype that dehumanizes Jews as controllers or enforcers of harmful behavior.

2. **Implication of Control and Antisemitic Stereotypes**: By suggesting that the opposing side is ""controlled by jews lobby"" and that this control leads to negative outcomes, the tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes where Jews are seen as manipulative actors behind harmful actions, which is a common antisemitic trope.

3. **Anti-Semitic Generalization**: The use of broad generalizations about ""Jews controlling institutions negatively"" without specific context or nuance constitutes essentializing, a key component of antisemitism according to the JDA's guidelines (Guideline A1).

4. **Stereotyping and Coded Language**: The phrase ""controlled by jews lobby"" employs coded language typical in antisemitic discourse, where certain groups are stereotyped as inherently controlling or evildoers without considering their individual circumstances or contributions.

In conclusion, the tweet uses harmful stereotypes, generalizes negatively about Jews' control over others, and employs coded language that all fit within the JDA's definition of antisemitism. Therefore, it is classified as antisemitic according to the provided framework."

This involves stereotyping a group and suggesting they are responsible for these actions, which aligns with antisemitic definitions that include using broad categories or stereotypes to incite hatred towards Jewish people or groups.

The tweet associates ""Jews"" with issues involving Palestinians, potentially implying that Jews are responsible for the treatment of other groups. This is problematic as it uses a stereotype (Jews) to explain actions against another group, which can be seen as inciting hatred and aligns with antisemitic behaviors defined by IHRA.

Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not engage with or promote any of the specific examples outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) as sources of antisemitism. Instead, it uses general conspiracy theories and blame-shifting without targeting specific groups or actions enumerated under JDA's guidelines. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Tweet Context**: The tweet discusses conspiracy theories about COVID-19 involving Jews and blames them instead of Israelis for treating Palestinians unfairly.

2. **Applying JDA Guidelines**: 
   - JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, or hostility against Jews based on their Jewish identity.
   - Antisemitic examples include linking Jews to negative stereotypes (guideline 2) and promoting harmful narratives about their group.

3. **Analyzing the Tweet's Content**:
   - The tweet suggests that COVID-19 conspiracies involve Jews, which could be seen as promoting stereotypical views of Jews.
   - It shifts blame from Israelis to Judaism, implying a negative association between Jews and Palestinian treatment.

4. **Evaluating Against JDA Criteria**:
   - The tweet does not reference specific JDA points like those in B (e.g., blaming agents or using symbols against Israel).
   - It avoids direct criticism of Israeli actions but instead targets a group (Jews) with negative connotations.
   
5. **Conclusion**: Since the tweet does not align with any JDA-defined examples and focuses on stereotyping rather than specific antisemitic acts, it is not considered antisemitic under the JDA's framework.

**Final Decision: No**, as the tweet does not engage with or promote antisemitism according to the JDA's definition."
