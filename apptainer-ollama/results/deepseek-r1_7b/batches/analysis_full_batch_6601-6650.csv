While this statement does not directly target specific Jewish individuals or institutions but rather implies a negative stereotype about Germany's approach to self-defense for Jews, it aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by using harmful stereotypes and potentially implying that Jews are collectively problematic without specific targeting. Therefore, it can be considered antisemitic under the IHRA framework.",No,"The tweet does not meet any of the criteria for antisemitism under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It discusses a potential political decision regarding international relations and national self-defense, without engaging in stereotypes, generalizations, or references to Jewish evil. Therefore, it is not antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.

The tweet focuses on the idea that Germany might provide advice to Jews for self-defense, which is a political statement rather than an antisemitic stereotype or reference to inherent evil traits of Jews. The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination based on race (specifically targeting Jews) and their institutions, but this tweet does not involve such elements. Instead, it addresses international relations in a factual context without any stereotyping or generalization about Jews.

In conclusion, the tweet is not considered antisemitic because it does not fall under any of the JDA's definitions related to antisemitism."

Okay, so I need to determine whether the tweet provided is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me start by reading the tweet carefully. The tweet is a retweet from Elenaforever13, saying that Jewish groups have condemned CNN's Don Lemon for his remarks suggesting that Black and Brown Jews don't exist.

First, I remember that according to JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. It can be expressed in words, images, deeds, etc., either directly or indirectly.

Now, the tweet is about Jewish groups condemning a remark by Don Lemon. The issue here is whether this criticism constitutes antisemitism. The user is asking if the tweet itself is antisemitic.

Looking at the guidelines provided: 

1. General Guidelines mention that essentializing or making broad negative generalizations against any group, including Jews, is antisemitic. Also, associating Jews with evil and using that to justify discrimination is a key point.
2. Antisemitism can be expressed in various forms—words, images, actions—and includes examples like slurs or coded messages.

The tweet is about Jewish groups addressing a statement made by Don Lemon. The fact that they are condemning it doesn't immediately make it antisemitic; it depends on what exactly they're saying and the context of their criticism.

But wait, in this case, the tweet is only mentioning that Jewish groups have condemned the remark but isn't providing any specifics about how they've done so. So the tweet itself is just a statement of criticism without detailing the nature of the remarks or the justification given by the Jewish groups.

However, the tweet's relevance to antisemitism would depend on what was being condemned. If Don Lemon's remarks were offensive and harmful towards Jews in a way that violates JDA's guidelines, then his statements themselves could be considered antisemitic. But the tweet is only about Jewish groups condemning him without further details.

But hold on—the tweet is part of the broader conversation. If the tweet is simply announcing that Jewish organizations have condemned someone for certain remarks, but it doesn't specify what those remarks were or how they were characterized by the Jewish groups as problematic, then perhaps the tweet isn't itself antisemitic in and of itself because it's just a statement of criticism without engaging with the specifics.

However, according to the guidelines, antisemitism is about the content. If Don Lemon's statements are considered antisemitic (e.g., he suggested that Black and Brown Jews don't exist), then his remarks themselves would be antisemitic. But the tweet isn't about Don Lemon's statements; it's about Jewish groups responding to them.

So, is the act ofcondemning someone else for their views on its own a form of antisemitism? According to JDA, it's not necessarily so unless the content being condemned is itself antisemitic. The tweet doesn't comment directly on what Don Lemon said; it just states that Jewish groups are condemning him.

But wait, no—Jewish groups are often the targets of antisemitic remarks because they are associated with negative stereotypes. So if a group is being used to condemn someone else's views, does that make the tweet itself antisemitic?

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Antisemitism includes using Jewishness as a basis for discrimination or targeting. If the criticism is based on Jewish groups' identity, it could be antisemitic.

But in this case, the tweet is about Jewish groups condemnation of Don Lemon's remarks. The tweet itself isn't making any statements that target Jews; it's just announcing that some groups are doing so. Unless the act of condemnation itself is part of a broader antisemitic narrative or pattern.

Alternatively, if the Jewish groups' criticism is rooted in problematic stereotypes (e.g., suggesting that Black and Brown Jews don't exist), then their criticism would be antisemitic because it's based on a false premise that disqualifies them as Jews. But again, this depends on what they're actually saying beyond just being called out.

But the tweet doesn't specify what the groups said—they just say ""Jewish groups have condemned."" So without more context, we can't know whether their criticism is itself antisemitic or not.

Wait, but according to JDA guidelines, if you're engaging in criticism that relies on negative stereotypes about Jews (like suggesting they don't exist), then your criticism would be antisemitic. However, the tweet here doesn't specify how they've characterized Don Lemon's remarks; it just says they've condemned them.

So perhaps this tweet isn't itself antisemitic because it's not engaging with specific content but is rather an announcement that certain groups have made a statement against someone else. Unless the act of condemning these remarks aligns with existing antisemitic narratives about Jews, which it might if they're using such stereotypes in their criticism.

But again, without knowing what exactly the Jewish groups said, we can't say for sure. So maybe this tweet isn't antisemitic on its own because it's just announcing a statement against someone else, not engaging with content that would involve targeting Jews themselves beyond the initial context of Don Lemon's remarks.

Alternatively, if the criticism is framed in a way that reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, then it could be considered part of an antisemitic pattern. But without more information on how the groups characterized Don Lemon's remarks, we can't definitively say this tweet itself is or isn't antisemitic.

Wait, but according to JDA, being a Jewish group in itself doesn't make you the target unless your criticism is based on negative stereotypes about Jews. So if the groups are using such stereotypes when they criticize Don Lemon, that would be antisemitic. But since we don't know how they characterized his remarks, perhaps it's not directly antisemitic.

But then again, antisemitism can also involve being part of a broader context where Jewish identities are used to target others. So if the criticism is framed in such a way that it's based on Jewish stereotypes or associations, then it could be antisemitic.

In conclusion, without more information on how the Jewish groups characterized Don Lemon's remarks and whether their criticism relies on negative stereotypes about Jews, we can't definitively say this tweet is or isn't antisemitic. However, given that antisemitism often involves using Jewishness as a basis for discrimination, if the groups' criticism is framed in such a way, it might be considered part of an antisemitic narrative.

Wait, but wait again—the tweet itself doesn't mention any specifics about how they've characterized Don Lemon's remarks. It just states that they've condemned him. So unless the act of conducing (condemning) involves applying negative stereotypes or using anti-Semitic language in their criticism, which isn't indicated here, then perhaps this tweet isn't antisemitic on its own.

However, the broader context is that Jewish groups often face criticism based on negative stereotypes about Jews themselves, so if their response to Don Lemon's remarks involves applying such stereotypes (e.g., suggesting that Black and Brown Jews don't exist), then it would be antisemitic. But since we don't know what exactly they said beyond just being called out for condemnation, perhaps this tweet is not itself antisemitic.

But wait another point: according to the guidelines, even the act of addressing such issues can sometimes be part of an antisemitic narrative if it relies on negative stereotypes or applies anti-Semitic biases. So maybe the fact that Jewish groups are being used to criticize Don Lemon's remarks, especially with claims about non-existing races among Jews, could make this tweet part of an antisemitic pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the tweet is a positive statement in support of diversity and inclusion, but it's phrased as a complaint. Without knowing the context beyond that, it's hard to tell. However, if we assume that the groups are using such remarks to attack Black and Brown Jews, which would align with existing antisemitic stereotypes, then this tweet could be considered part of an antisemitic narrative.

In summary, without more information on how exactly the Jewish groups have characterized Don Lemon's remarks in their criticism, it's difficult to determine definitively. However, given that JDA focuses on anti-Semitic content and using Jewishness as a basis for discrimination, if the groups' criticism relies on negative stereotypes or reinforces such biases about Jews, then this tweet could be part of an antisemitic narrative.

But wait again—the tweet is simply announcing that Jewish groups have condemned Don Lemon's remarks. Unless those remarks themselves are being used to target or attack Jews in a negative way beyond just his statements, the tweet itself isn't antisemitic on its face because it doesn't contain any anti-Semitic content—it's an announcement of criticism without engaging with specific content.

However, if the groups' criticism is rooted in applying anti-Semitic stereotypes (like suggesting that Black and Brown Jews don't exist), then their act of criticism could be considered part of an antisemitic pattern. But again, since we don't know how they framed their criticism beyond just calling out Don Lemon's remarks, it's hard to say.

So perhaps the safest answer is: The tweet itself isn't directly antisemitic because it doesn't contain anti-Semitic content—it's simply announcing that certain groups have condemned someone else. However, if the groups' criticism of Don Lemon relies on negative stereotypes about Jews or attacks Black and Brown Jews specifically, then this could be considered part of an antisemitic narrative.

But since we don't know that from the tweet alone, maybe it's better to say that without more information on how the groups framed their criticism, the tweet isn't directly antisemitic. However, given the context around antisemitism and Jewish identity issues, this could be interpreted as such if it aligns with existing anti-Semitic narratives.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the tweet just announces that Jewish groups have condemned someone else, without any indication of how they framed their criticism or using negative stereotypes about Jews themselves in their criticism, maybe it's not antisemitic on its own.

Alternatively, if we consider that being a Jewish group and engaging in criticism based on stereotypes could be part of an antisemitic context, then perhaps this tweet is a signal within an existing antisemitic narrative.

Hmm. This is getting quite complex. To sum up:

- Antisemitism involves targeting Jews negatively.
- If the tweet's content or framing uses negative stereotypes about Jews (e.g., suggesting they don't include Black and Brown people), it could be antisemitic.
- Without knowing how the groups framed their criticism, we can't say for sure.

But since the tweet just announces that certain groups have condemned someone else without specifying their approach, perhaps it's not directly antisemitic. However, if this is part of a broader context where Jewish groups are using anti-Semitic language or stereotypes when they criticize others, then yes, it could be considered part of an antisemitic narrative.

But given the information provided in the tweet alone, I think it's safer to say that without more context on how the criticism was framed, we can't definitively determine if the tweet is antisemitic. However, considering the broader implications and possible alignment with existing anti-Semitic narratives about Jews, perhaps this could be part of an antisemitic context.

Wait, but according to JDA, being a Jewish group isn't itself an antisemitic act unless you're applying anti-Semitic content or stereotypes in your criticism. So if they're just announcing the existence of criticism without engaging negatively towards Jews themselves, then it's not inherently antisemitic.

But if their criticism is framed in such a way that uses negative stereotypes about Jews (like suggesting they don't include Black and Brown people), then yes, it could be part of an antisemitic narrative.

So perhaps the answer depends on whether the tweet's context involves applying anti-Semitic stereotypes. But since we don't have information beyond the announcement, maybe we should say that this tweet isn't directly antisemitic because it doesn't contain such content—it just announces a statement against someone else.

But wait, another angle: Sometimes, when people use hashtags or labels to target groups, even if they're not directly using anti-Semitic language, they can still be part of an antisemitic context. But again, without knowing how the groups framed their criticism beyond announcing it via this tweet, we don't have enough info.

In conclusion, I think the safest answer is that based solely on the content of the tweet itself, which just announces that certain Jewish groups have condemned someone else, there's no evidence provided to suggest that it contains anti-Semitic content. Therefore, the tweet isn't directly antisemitic. However, if this is part of a broader context where such criticism aligns with existing anti-Semitic narratives about Jews, then perhaps it could be considered as such.

But since the question asks whether the tweet itself is antisemitic, I think we have to stick with what's in the tweet and not assume beyond that.

The tweet in question simply announces that certain Jewish groups have condemned someone else without providing specific details of how they framed their criticism. Since it does not contain anti-Semitic content or use negative stereotypes about Jews themselves, it is not inherently antisemitic on its own. However, if this tweet is part of a broader context where such criticism aligns with existing anti-Semitic narratives about Jews, it could be considered within an antisemitic context.

Alright, I need to determine if the provided tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

First, let me read the tweet again. It's a retweet by Jeremy Levin stating that Jews are told from a young age that their identities are tied to Israel. The last part seems cut off with some symbols.

Looking at the guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews based on their Jewishness or Jewish institutions. The tweet talks about identity tied to Israel, which is a central point of antisemitic stereotypes.

Guideline 2 mentions how Jews are often linked to evil and harmful forces like anti-Semitism involving conspiracy theories about control over powerful institutions. This ties into the idea that Jews are associated with negative stereotypes and hidden powers, fitting the definition.

Also, the tweet supports Israeli policies as presented, but according to guideline C.11, supporting Palestinian demands for justice is non-antisemitic if done in line with international law. However, the main issue is the link between Jewish identity and Israel, which falls under antisemitic content.

So overall, yes, this tweet is antisemitic because it associates Jewish identity with a specific state, which is a common antisemitic stereotype.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet in question supports or reinforces stereotypical associations of Jews with the modern State of Israel. According to the JDA's guidelines, antisemitism includes linking Jews with negative stereotypes and harmful narratives about their identity. The tweet suggests that Jewish identity is intrinsically tied to Israel, which aligns with antisemitic ideas about Jews being linked to evil forces or problematic political entities.

The tweet does not provide any counterarguments or support for Palestinian demands; it simply presents a statement about Jewish identity tied to Israel. This falls under the category of B.1-6, examples that are antisemitic on the face of it because it associates Jewish identity with a specific state in a harmful way. There is no indication that the tweet addresses alternative viewpoints or challenges the stereotypical link between Jews and Israeli nationalism.

In conclusion, the tweet supports or reinforces stereotypical and harmful associations about Jews linked to Israel, making it antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

However, it does not explicitly target individuals, institutions, or use negative stereotypes typical of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

2. **Generalization Without Evidence**: The tweet broadens the scope by making claims about an entire category ( owners wna ) behaving like Jews. Such generalizations without factual basis can essentialize groups, which is problematic as per JDA guidelines.

While it does not explicitly reference the JDA's guidelines, such as coded speech or generalization about Jews, its message could be interpreted as reinforcing negative stereotypes and highlighting a perceived lack of Jew support in cancellations for similar reasons as racism. This aligns with antisemitism as defined by the JDA, particularly through stereotyping and making broad generalizations about a population based on inherent characteristics (racism)."

This aligns with JDA guidelines as it employs generalizations that essentialize Jews, treating them as inherently evil or part of a hostile force.

The tweet in question is a reaction to another tweet about Igbo Jews praying at a synagogue in Anambra, stating ""Thank you."" This tweet does not explicitly target or make any negative statements about Jewish individuals, groups, or practices.

1397671702134464519,ProudTiger1,2021-05-26 21:51:15+00:00,0,Jews,RT @KateB747: EXCLUSIVE COVERAGE: Jews Attacked By Jihad-Terror Mobs at Rally For Israel in NYC Times Square https://t.co/SCibmdrj0j via @p�,Yes,"The tweet describes an incident where Jews were attacked by Jihad-terror mobs at a rally in NYC. While it does not explicitly express hatred, the event itself involves targeting a specific group (Jews) due to their association with Judaism and ideological labels. This can be interpreted as contributing to antisemitism by stigmatizing Jews based on their perceived identity or association with terrorist groups, aligning with IHRA's definition which includes directing hatred or discrimination toward Jewish communities or related entities.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition Review:** Antisemitism involves hatred directed at Jews, expressed or physical, targeting individuals or places associated with Jewishness.
2. **Tweet Content:** The tweet reports an attack by Jihad-terror mobs on a rally of Jews in NYC's Times Square.
3. **Contextual Analysis:** The tweet describes the incident without personal comments but frames it as exclusive coverage.
4. **Potential Interpretation:** By linking the mob to Jihad and terrorism, which may associate with anti-Semitic stereotypes or ideologies, the tweet could imply discrimination against Jews based on their perceived group identity.
5. **Conclusion:** While not directly expressing hatred, the tweet's context and framing of an attack on a specific ideological/mob target associated with Jews can be seen as contributing to antisemitism under IHRA's criteria.

Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to its association of a terrorist mob with Jewish communities.",No,"The tweet describes an event where Jews were attacked by Jihad-terror mobs at a rally in NYC Times Square. While it could potentially align with negative stereotypes or reinforce existing biases about Jews being involved in terrorist activities, the tweet itself does not explicitly use discriminatory language or essentialize Jews as inherent members of hostile groups beyond the context provided. The description is factual and does not go beyond what can be reasonably interpreted without explicit antisemitic content.

However, according to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism can manifest through the association with negative stereotypes or symbols, even if not explicitly used. In this case, the tweet could be seen as reinforcing a stereotype of Jews being involved in terrorist activities. While it does not directly use antisemitic language, its context and potential implications might align with such stereotypes.

Thus, based on the JDA definition, the tweet could be considered to touch upon an area that is associated with antisemitism by implying or reinforcing negative associations about Jews and their support for Israel. Therefore, according to the guidelines, it may be viewed as having elements of antisemitism due to its potential context or implications.

Wait, but in my initial assessment, I concluded No because the tweet itself didn't use any explicit antisemitic language or essentialize Jews beyond describing an event. However, considering that the tweet describes a situation where Jews are attacked by Jihad-terror mobs targeting them for supporting Israel, it could be interpreted as aligning with the idea that Jews are behind such attacks, which is a form of antisemitism according to JDA guidelines.

Therefore, after careful consideration, I now lean towards Yes because the tweet implies an association between Jacobs and terrorism without explicitly stating it, which could be seen as part of antisemitic narratives.

It does not express any hatred, demonization, or conspiracy theories about Jews. Instead, it appears to be a light-hearted joke without intent to offend or target any group. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by the IHRA.

Another example according to the IHRA definition:

IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism:
""Antisemitism is defined as a certain perception of Jews... expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.""

Examples of antisemitic expressions include calling for harm in the name of ideology, making dehumanizing allegations, associating Jews with conspiracies, and using symbols like those from Nazism. The tweet does not involve any of these elements but instead uses humor unrelated to antisemitism.

The IHRA definition emphasizes directed hatred or perception, which this tweet lacks. It does not attribute negative intent toward specific groups beyond a pun.

**Final Decision:** No

Explanation: The tweet in question is merely a humorous play on words and does not exhibit any form of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.",No,"The tweet uses a pun that includes ""Jews"" in a context suggesting negative connotations, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes. While it's not overt criticism of Israel but could be seen as offensive due to the stereotypical reference, it does not explicitly deny the Holocaust or support Israeli policies, thus aligning with antisemitism by applying stereotypes."

It does not target specific Jewish individuals, use negative stereotypes, or reference antisemitic rhetoric as defined by the IHRA.

**Final Answer:**

DECISION: No  
The tweet is not antisemitic based on the IHRA definition because it does not explicitly target Jewish individuals with hate speech or negative stereotypes, nor does it reference antisemitic ideologies.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews are hated because of their laws, implying a belief in their inherent evilness. This aligns with JDA guidelines 2 and 6-10, which involve promoting harmful stereotypes about Jews being inherently evil due to their societal structures or laws. Such statements contribute to antisemitism by essentializing Jews and reinforcing negative perceptions."

Ah, the double standards!",Yes,"The tweet employs stereotypical language by equating Jews with settlers (""Jews are settlers"") in comparison to the Rohingyas being refugees. This associates an ethnic group with a negative stereotype (settlements) without directly targeting Jewish individuals, thereby contributing to antisemitism as defined by IHRA. The use of ""double standards"" implies unfair treatment towards Jews relative to others, aligning with antisemitic rhetoric that uses negative stereotypes and biased comparisons.",Yes,"The tweet employs the term ""Jews are settlers,"" which is a stereotype often used to dismiss or demean Jewish communities, similar to how ""settlement"" can imply displacement or inferiority. Additionally, by drawing an analogy between refugees and settlers, it implies a double standard, suggesting that Jews are treated less fairly despite their contributions or challenges. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines regarding applying negative stereotypes (entry 6) and implying discrimination or bias (entry 8). Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic as it reinforces stereotypes and suggests unfair treatment."
