These terms target Jews, fitting the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by perpetuating stereotypes and promoting a negative perception of Jewish people. The use of such language aims to stigmatize Jews within a hateful context, aligning with antisemitic rhetoric that seeks to marginalize or attack specific groups based on their perceived characteristics tied to extremist ideologies.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory terms such as ""Zio,"" ""ZioNazi,"" and ""ZioScum"" directed at Jews (Jews) as a specific group. These slurs are intended to demean and stereotype Jews, which constitutes antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. The use of these terms falls under Guidelines 1 and 2, where essentializing or making negative generalizations about a population is considered antisemitic. Additionally, the tweet's suggestion to include such slurs in official definitions further escalates its harmful nature by perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes."

This label is frequently used in antisemitic contexts to stereotype Israelis or Jews negatively. Additionally, while the tweet mentions a Palestinian child, its use of anti-Israeli language targets a broader category (Israelis) rather than directly addressing Jews as a group. Therefore, it aligns with the IHRA definition by expressing hatred towards a group perceived as Jewish through stereotyping and labeling.",No,"The tweet in question uses the term ""Zionazi,"" which implies association with Zionism and could be interpreted as labeling an individual associated with Jewish policy or practices. This tag essentializes a person based on their Jewishness without sufficient justification, contributing to antisemitism by applying a negative stereotype."

By referring to ""ZioNazis"" and implying that supporting Israel's actions towards Palestinians negates anti-semitism, it frames this support as a way to avoid hatred. This conflates the victims (Palestinians) with the group being judged (Jews through ZioNazis), promoting hatred against a non-Jewish nation. It aligns with IHRA's definition by expressing hatred and assigning blame towards a specific national group based on anti-Semitic stereotypes.",No,"The tweet in question uses several elements that align with the antisemitic criteria outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Equating Criticism of Israel with Antisemitism**: The tweet suggests that supporting Israel to protect Palestinian victims is necessary to avoid being anti-Semitic. This directly ties criticism of Israel, a Jewish state, with anti-Semitism.

2. **Negative Stereotypes and Labels**: The use of terms like ""ZioNazis"" combines Zionism (support for Israel) with anti-Semitic connotations, reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews.

3. **Language and Connotations**: The word ""murder"" is used in a accusatory tone towards Palestinian victims, which is highly inappropriate and indicative of antisemitic language.

4. **Stereotyping and Generalization**: The tweet implies that opposing Israel constitutes anti-Semitism, which involves stereotyping and generalizing about Jewish people or their institutions.

In summary, the tweet uses harmful language, equates criticism of a Jewish state with anti-Semitism, and employs negative stereotypes that conflate Zionism with anti-Semitism. These elements collectively make the tweet antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines."

It uses the term ""Zionist"" in a way that associates Jewish people with negative stereotypes, potentially suggesting a broader conspiracy theory about their roles in controlling certain institutions. The inclusion of ""Satanist-run"" adds another layer of negativity, implying control by a negative group. These stereotypical generalizations and broad conspiracy claims about groups including Jews meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined, targeting them through associations rather than direct criticism. Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic under the IHRA's guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet employs language that conflates Zionism with negative connotations, referencing terms like ""ZioN Nazi"" to stigmatize Jews. While NSA/CentralBanker are neutral, the inclusion of ""Zionist"" and ""Satanist-run"" could imply a link to oppressive ideologies, aligning with antisemitic tropes by associating Jews with negative traits without basis in factual context."

These actions align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using stereotypes and negative character traits to criticize groups perceived as Jewish.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Zionazis"" in reference to the Golan Heights being illegally occupied.

By calling someone an ""agent provocateur"" targeting a seat in the EU parliament, it uses a stereotypical label tied to Jewish identity (Zionism) to provoke political discussion, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as involving negative stereotypes and collectively blaming Jews for societal issues or conspiracies.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews but associates Zionism with a speculative political role, using the term ""Zionazi"" which implies negative stereotypes about Zionism itself. However, it does not use anti-Semitic language or imagery against Jews directly and instead critiques their association without overtly hostile remarks.

However, under IHRA's definition, antisemitism specifically targets Jews or their institutions. This tweet does not directly target specific Jewish individuals but frames a broader criticism of Israel, which could be conflated with anti-Semitism. Without explicitly targeting Jews or using antisemitic language that refers to them by name or status, it doesn't fully meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet ""Zionazi terrorists strike again #GazaUnderAttack #IsraeliCrimes #BDS"" does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it uses terms like ""Zionazi"" which are often associated with Jews and Zionism, the tweet refers to ""terrorists,"" a broad category that can apply to many groups without specifically targeting individual Jews. The mention of ""BDS"" is also neutral in this context. Therefore, the tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA because it does not essentialize or specifically target individual Jewish people but rather labels a general group without specific intent to harm any particular Jewish individual."

By addressing a public figure by name and associating them with a stereotype related to Jewish identity (Zionism), the tweet perpetuates antisemitic stereotypes. Additionally, the use of the term ""hatred"" towards zionazis reflects a negative stereotype about Jews, fitting within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves directing hatred at individuals based on their perceived Jewishness through stereotypical language and association.",Yes,"The tweet targets a group referred to as ""zionazis,"" which can encompass Jewish individuals in the diaspora. By suggesting that a leader treated them as bouncers, it implies unwelcome behavior towards specific Jewish people outside Israel. While the term may not exclusively target all Jews, the context and language used reflect discriminatory intent against certain groups, aligning with antisemitic practices as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA)."

Therefore, the tweet promotes antisemitic perceptions as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""ZioNazis,"" which is a coded reference to denote a negative stereotype about Jews. This aligns with guideline 2, where antisemitism often involves linking Jews to evil forces like the Nazis. By rejecting this term, it fits into B. Israel and Palestine: examples that are antisemitic (guideline 6), using symbols or stereotypes to target Jews negatively. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to JDA."

This constitutes a form of antisemitism by perpetuating harmful stereotypes about Jewish people, fitting within IHRA's definition of antisemitic expressions that target or perpetuate negative perceptions toward Jews.",Yes,"The tweet ""@middleoo Stupid filthy zionazi"" contains several elements that align with antisemitic content as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Language used**: The words ""Stupid"" and ""filthy"" are discriminatory, attacking the recipient's intelligence or morality without basis.
2. **Slang term**: ""Zionazi"" is a derogatory term often used to stereotype Jews as lazy or situated in poverty, fitting the definition of antisemitic language that essentializes or pre-judices a population based on ethnicity.

These elements together constitute antisemitism under the JDA guidelines by involving discrimination and prejudice against a specific ethnic group without valid justification."

Key points include:

1. **Stereotyping and Labels**: The use of ""Zionist"" and ""Satanist"" labels applies negative stereotypes often associated with Jewish groups, which are harmful when used to target individuals or institutions without justification.

2. **Power Dynamics**: The assertion that Central Banks and NSAs are under ""Zionist Nazi/Satanist-run"" implies control by hostile forces, reinforcing exclusionary narratives typically linked to antisemitism.

3. **Coded Language**: References like ""Nazi"" combined with ""Zionist"" suggest an ideological conflation often used in antisemitic discourse.

These elements together indicate the tweet promotes harmful stereotypes and aligns with the JDA's guidelines on applying antisemitic language and ideologies, thus qualifying it as antisemitic."

It employs the term ""ZIONAZISM"" to associate Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi) and Donald Trump with a political movement that supports Israel, potentially implying support for actions perceived as harmful or expansions of Jewish interests. This use of the term associates the politicians with negative stereotypes about Zionism and Israel, which can be interpreted as perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jewish people to harmful political actions. Thus, it falls under the category of antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet employs the term ""ZIONAZISM,"" which is a slur often used to imply anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, associating it with Bibi (presumably Benjamin Netanyahu) and Trump. This aligns with point B.7 of the JDA, where applying negative stereotypes or symbols from classical antisemitism to the State of Israel is considered antisemitic.

4. **Broad Accusation**: The tweet broadly accuses Israelis of antisemitic behavior without specific targeting, which could extend hatred towards Jews as an ideological group, fitting the IHRA's criteria for expressing hatred or discrimination against Jewish individuals or communities.

In conclusion, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism by targeting a Jewish community with harmful language and accusations.",Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the antisemitic criteria outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Association of Jews with Harmful Actions**: The tweet explicitly labels Muslims as being ""slaughtered"" by Israeli government agents, directly associating them with harm. This ties into point 2 of the JDA, which links Jews to forces of evil.

2. **Conspiracy and Control Implied for Jews**: By mentioning ""Zionazism"" and implying that Israeli actions involve transnational corporations (Rothschild), the tweet suggests a broader conspiracy involving Jews. This aligns with point 2's idea of Jews being part of forces of evil.

3. **Association with Bribes and Media Influence**: The claim about bribery of Democratic leadership introduces an anti-Semitic stereotype by associating non-Jews (Democrats) with corrupt activities, akin to essentializing groups based on their association with Jews.

4. **Stereotyping and Essentialization**: Using terms like ""Zionazism"" implies a negative stereotype without evidence, leading to the perception that Democrats are manipulative or part of a conspiracy involving Jews.

Instead, it attacks Trump's actions using the term ""ZioNazi,"" which is a pejorative term referring to Zionists and their association with antisemitism. However, this usage alone does not constitute antisemitism as defined by JDA because it does not equate Jews or imply specific prejudice against them in an antisemitic context. The tweet's content focuses on political brinkmanship and threats, without addressing or targeting Jewish individuals or groups. Therefore, according to the guidelines, the tweet is not antisemitic.

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination or hostility directed specifically at Jews (or Jewish institutions), which this tweet does not do. Instead, it uses a term that could imply criticism of Zionism but does not target Jews themselves. The guidelines emphasize that using such terms in this context does not inherently make the tweet antisemitic unless it equates Jews with specific actions or characteristics. Since this tweet does not meet those criteria, it is not considered antisemitic.

Additionally, the JDA's guidelines mention that expressions of solidarity against antisemitism can be based on general principles (like human rights) rather than personal attacks. This tweet falls into a category where it expresses concern about political actions without directly targeting Jews or using antisemitic stereotypes in service of a broader critique. Therefore, it is not antisemitic as defined.

The absence of specific or overt references to Jews or their characteristics in the tweet means that the guidelines regarding identification with evil forces ( guideline 2) are not triggered here either. The mention of ""ZioNazi"" could be seen as anti-Zionist, but that does not by itself equate to antisemitism unless it is used to target specific Jewish people or groups.

In summary, while the term ""ZioNazi"" might suggest a negative stereotype about Zionists and thus Jews in some contexts, this tweet does not explicitly or contextually target Jewish individuals. It focuses on political actions without any overtly antisemitic content, making it not antisemitic according to JDA guidelines.

While the use of terms like ""Zionais"" might carry connotations related to Zionism, it's important to note that in this context, it appears to be used as a derogatory slur directed at Jews. However, the primary issue with antisemitism is not just the term itself but how it is applied and whether it constitutes discrimination based on race or ethnicity without justification. In this case, the tweet does not explicitly or implicitly target individuals by their Jewish identity in a discriminatory manner, hence it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

But upon reevaluation, considering that ""Zionais"" is often used to imply that Jews are criminals and the hashtag #IsraelCrimes suggests blame on Israel without addressing its complexities or contributions, this tweet could be interpreted as part of an antisemitic narrative. It discriminates against Jews by labeling them collectively in a negative way, which aligns with guidelines regarding applying negative stereotypes (point 6) and treating Jews as a group without basis.

It also connects Holocaust denial with Jews, reinforcing antisemitic associations. This aligns with the IHRA definition by targeting Jews through negative connotations and references, making it antisemitic.",No,"The tweet uses ethnic slurs such as ""aborigines"" (a derogatory term for Black people) and ""Zionazis"" (a misused term for Jews), which are forms of stereotyping. It also refers to Holocaust denial, a known antisemitic act, and describes Jews in a negative light serving superrich donors under the guise of a ""barbaric effect."" These elements align with the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism, particularly regarding stereotyping and linking Jews to harmful forces."

The real racists won the election. ??,No,"The tweet uses the term ""zionazi,"" which is a derogatory slur against Jews or Jewish people, and suggests that real racists won an election. While this language aligns with anti-Semitic terminology, the tweet does not explicitly target Jews as a collective group but rather accuses anti-Semites of influencing the election. The context implies that non-Jews are responsible for anti-Semitic claims, which could be seen as inciting hatred or spreading negative stereotypes about Jews. However, it does not directly accuse or express hatred toward Jews themselves, so it falls short of fully meeting the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses words to accuse Zionists (often associated with Israelis) of making false anti-Semitic claims against Prime Minister Corbyn, suggesting that real racists won the election. While this does not directly label Jews as racists, it implies a negative judgment about a group often linked to Israeli political discourse. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews, either as a group or through their institutions. The tweet's accusation of Zionists as being racists could be interpreted as applying anti-Semitic stereotypes or judgments, thus fitting within the JDA's definition by indirectly targeting a group associated with Jewish identity and political stance."
