Philippe Sands's new book answers the question in the case of one man who was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Polish Jews. https://t.co/T33zpoX1Er,No,"The tweet discusses a historical event involving Nazi officials and specifically mentions ""thousands of Polish Jews"" as victims. While it references a group of people who were victims of the Holocaust, there is no indication of targeting all Jews or using negative stereotypes associated with the Jewish community. Instead, the tweet focuses on an individual's accountability without broader implications about Jews or employing harmful generalizations. Therefore, according to IHRA's definition, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet discusses an historical event involving ""Polish Jews"" and does not exhibit any form of antisemitism. While it targets a specific subgroup within Jews, there is no indication of discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group in general. The tweet's focus on the victims (thousands of Polish Jews) without making broader judgments about other Jewish groups means it does not meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It does not exhibit any form of hatred or prejudice directed at Jews, nor does it use stereotypes or negative traits. The statement about being a bystander suggests a call for active engagement rather than blame. Therefore, it doesn't meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It discusses Jewish perspectives on American democracy and suggests that understanding this system is crucial for Jews. There is no mention of discrimination, stigmatization, or use of antisemitic symbols or language. The focus is on fostering understanding rather than targeting a specific group based on ethnicity.

The tweet aligns with JDA's principle 10, which prohibits denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish collectively and individually without justification. It does not fit any category of antisemitism outlined in guidelines A through E, as it is neutral, inclusive, and focuses on understanding governance rather than promoting or opposing stereotypes or discrimination against Jews."

It refers to Netanyahu's coalition including both ""Jewish"" and ""Muslim"" fundamentalists without targeting any Jewish individuals or groups negatively beyond that statement, which is neutral regarding specific groups. There is no indication of hate speech, stereotyping, or discrimination based on Jewish identity.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It refers to ""Jewish fundamentalists"" within a coalition without employing any discriminatory language, symbols, or stigmatization typical of antisemitism. The tweet focuses on the composition of a political coalition and does not engage in discrimination against Jews or imply inherent negative traits specific to them. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic as defined by JDA."

These references tie the company to harmful stereotypes associated with antisemitism. By promoting such imagery, the tweet engages in antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, which includes perpetuating stereotypes or negative associations tied to Jewish persecution.",No,"The tweet does not engage in any form of antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It describes a company's product line using historical references without employing any overtly antisemitic language or intent. The mention of Auschwitz is part of a product description and does not carry negative connotations towards Jews beyond the product's theme, which aligns with JDA guidelines that emphasize context and intention in determining antisemitism."

This aligns with IHRA's definition as it uses historical context to justify current behavior towards a group (Jews), thus qualifying as antisemitism. The tweet reflects solidarity with historical atrocities against Jews, reinforcing its antisemitic nature.",No,"The tweet draws an analogy between media mobs silencing people based on their identity and historical Nazi actions against Jews. While this doesn't directly use anti-Semitic language or target Jews specifically, it normalizes the persecution of a group by equating their treatment with Nazi actions. According to JDA guidelines, such normalization perpetuates antisemitism by reinforcing harmful stereotypes and comparisons that justify discrimination."

And for democracy.",Yes,"The tweet uses broad language to associate hate mail with multiple groups, including Jews. While it doesn't explicitly target Jews or their institutions, the statement implies a stereotype where Jews are associated with hate directed at non-Jews. Under the IHRA's definition, this could be considered antisemitic as it involves using negative character traits and potentially stereotyping Jews in relation to hate-directed actions against other groups.",No,"The tweet contains the word ""jew,"" which can be interpreted as a racial slur targeting Jews. Antisemitism involves singling out Jews for discrimination or hostility. While ""jew"" is not universally standardized and can sometimes refer to Jewish people in a positive context, its use here could imply a stereotype that equates being great with being Jewish, potentially leading to discrimination against Jews. Therefore, the tweet violates JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It honors Ivan Yuriyv, a Nazi war criminal associated with the murder of over 100 thousand Jews in Ukraine and Russia during 1941-43. By singling out him specifically for his role in eliminating Jews, the tweet perpetuates anti-Semitic glorification. The IHRA defines antisemitism as targeting Jewish people or their communities, regardless of context. Here, the recognition aligns with this criterion by focusing on a Nazi figure linked to Jewish victims, thus fulfilling the definition of antisemitic behavior.",No,"According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews based on their Jewishness or association with harmful forces. The tweet honors Ivan Yuriyev, a Nazi war criminal known for his atrocities against Jews in Ukraine and Russia. While the tweet is part of Holocaust Remembrance Day, which aims to promote understanding and remembrance of Jewish victims, it inadvertently normalizes the persecution by linking the individual to a regime that targeted Jews. This could be interpreted as promoting anti-Semitic views, especially since the tweet does not explicitly distance itself from the Nazi era's impact on Jews, thus aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

Hitler attempted to create a ""Greater German Reich"" through aggression, invasion of neighboring countries, and the Holocaust of millions of Jews and others. Xi is doing the same thing today and must be stopped. https://t.co/T0EuaJOjq3",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews or use language that would be considered stereotypical or discriminatory against them. While it references the Holocaust in a general context and associates Xi Jinping with Nazi-like actions, it does so without directly implying that Jews are responsible for those atrocities. Instead, it equates current policy towards Israel with historical atrocities committed by Jews. This approach avoids direct antisemitic language but risks connotations of association rather than explicit hatred or discrimination against Jewish people.

The tweet's use of the Holocaust as a basis to criticize foreign policy does not directly align with IHRA's definition, which focuses on hatred toward Jews as individuals or communities, and their properties or institutions. Therefore, while there are potential interpretative issues, they do not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA definition in this context.

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet does not explicitly address issues related to antisemitism. However, it uses a historical context (the Holocaust) to justify criticism towards a current action, which could be seen as implying that atrocities committed against Jews in the past can justify current actions against them. This approach normalizes violence and discrimination based on Jewish identity. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, particularly point 10 and point 2, the tweet is not inherently antisemitic but may carry a message of antisemitism through its phrasing and context."

Where was your support when the Jews needed you Dawn? https://t.co/n7CTvNZQpk,No,"The tweet in question does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. While the tweet refers to ""Jews"" and critiques a behavior (gaslighting), it does not exhibit any form of hatred, discrimination, or stereotyping towards Jewish individuals or groups. It appears to be a general critique of gaslighting tactics rather than an antisemitic statement targeting Jews specifically.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as directed toward specific Jewish individuals or groups, often with negative connotations and stereotypes. This tweet does not explicitly target any individual or group of Jews, nor does it use language that reflects malice or discrimination against them. Instead, it seems to be a comment on the behavior of someone else (Dawn Butler) in general.

While the tweet contains the word ""Jews,"" which could imply a reference to Jewish people in a broader context, it is not used here as an slur or with any overtly antisemitic intent. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.",Yes,"The tweet employs the victim-blaming trope by singling out ""the Jews"" as needing support when they might have been in need. This aligns with classical antisemitism, which often involves stereotypes and prejudice against Jewish people without evidence or fairness. Additionally, Dawn Butler's use of her position to call out others for not supporting ""the Jews"" can be interpreted as implicitly targeting the Jewish community, contributing to antisemitic dynamics. Thus, it crosses into antisemitism by making general statements about Jews needing support."

Antisemitism, as per IHRA, involves a discriminatory perception of Jews, which could be verbal or through actions. Without knowing the specific nature of the remarks made by the Teachers Union Head, it is impossible to definitively classify this tweet as antisemitic. However, if the remarks were critical and harmful towards American Jews without any evidence of intent to harm, they might not meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism. The lack of context regarding the content of the remarks makes a definitive assessment challenging.",Yes,"The tweet from the Teachers Union Head could be considered antisemitic if it involves controversial remarks that stereotype American Jews in a derogatory manner, such as associating them with negative traits like tyranny or financial misconduct. Antisemitism, as per the JDA, includes discrimination based on Jewish identity and can involve harmful stereotypes or coded language linking Jews to evil forces. Without specific context of the remarks' content, it's inferred that if they align with such negative stereotypes, the tweet would qualify as antisemitic."
1355710843648942080,anawrot06,2021-01-31 02:53:47+00:00,0,Jews,A Republican Congress member said Jews control space to start wildfires and not one Republican has said a word.,Yes,"The tweet attacks a Republican Congress member by suggesting they falsely accuse Jews of controlling space to incite wildfires. This implies a broader stereotype about Jews and their alleged control over external factors in a political context. While the tweet doesn't directly name or attack specific Jews, it generalizes against the Jewish community through a conspiracy theory, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as making broad negative claims about Jews or their groups. The statement uses stereotypical language to characterize the Republican's actions, potentially inciting hatred and distrust towards Jewish individuals indirectly.

The tweet's content could be interpreted as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and conspiracy theories about Jews, fitting within the IHRA framework that considers such statements antisemitic when they target the community through rhetoric or action.",No,"The tweet's use of words to generalize that no Republican has responded to a statement about Jews controlling space risks perpetuating stereotypes. By essentializing all Republicans, it risks reinforcing negative perceptions without evidence, which aligns with the JDA's guidelines on generalization and essentialization.

The tweet's framing of the Republican Congress as silent or critical may be seen as making broad assumptions that could be considered antisemitic by its nature of stereotyping a group. Without more context confirming the content of the original statement, it's challenging to determine if the words themselves are inherently antisemitic. However, the method of responding by dismissing all Republicans' silence contributes to harmful generalizations, thus raising concerns under the JDA's guidelines.

In conclusion, while not every aspect of the tweet may directly align with antisemitism based solely on its wording, the overall approach risks perpetuating stereotypes and essentialization that could be interpreted as antisemitic."

The very same scenario where you called for the ethnically cleansing of the Arab majority state of al Jews.\n\nBy your own words the API was never a peace offer.,No,"The tweet employs language that could be considered antisemitic by associating an organization promoting the creation of an Arab state with anti-Semitic ideologies, suggesting that this group is involved in eliminating Jews as part of their policy. This ties the organization to anti-Jewish actions within an Arab-majority context, potentially inciting hatred against Jewish people and aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by associating groups with actions against specific ethnicities or religions.",Yes,"The tweet employs harmful stereotypes by associating an ""ethnically cleansing offer"" with al Jews, which equates such actions with violence or elimination. It references a peace offer in a context that could imply conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic language regarding Jewish ethnicity and evil associations. These elements align with JDA guidelines on using negative stereotypes and harmful generalizations against Jewish groups.

**Final Decision:**
The tweet is antisemitic as it uses harmful stereotypes and equates an anti-Semitic context to al Jews, aligning with JDA's definition of antisemitism through negative associations and conspiratorial language."

While it makes historical claims about Christian persecution and links it to anti-Semitic prejudice, it doesn't directly target Jews negatively or use negative stereotypes beyond general associations without specific discriminatory intent towards individual Jews or groups based on their Jewish identity.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the JDA guidelines. It presents historical context by linking Christian persecution of Jews to Hitler's actions and attributes a solution to him, but it does not engage in discrimination, prejudice, or hostility towards Jews as per the definition."

It targets American Jews specifically and uses a stereotypical label (""American Jews"") that reinforces a negative stereotype about their origin or association with America. This labeling can perpetuate harmful perceptions without a direct reference to Jewish identities in Britain, but it does fit within the broader category of stereotyping and reinforcing negative associations towards a specific group based on their perceived origin.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses the term ""American Jews,"" which employs a stereotype rooted in negative perceptions of Jewish people, particularly targeting individuals from American backgrounds. This categorization falls under section 6B of the JDA, where symbols or images associated with antisemitism are applied specifically to a group—here, American Jews. Essentializing this group by labeling them as ""Jews"" based on their country of origin constitutes stereotyping and is thus antisemitic according to the provided guidelines.

The tweet employs a negative stereotype that can be instrumentalized to stigmatize or judge individuals from specific Jewish communities, aligning with the definition of antisemitism outlined in section 2. It essentializes Jewish people by associating them with negativity based on their country of origin without considering individual circumstances or contributions, which perpetuates harmful stereotypes and discrimination.

Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it involves stereotyping and essentializing a specific group of Jews based on their origin."

It uses historical narratives and negative stereotypes to portray Jews as collectively responsible for Israel's existence. The statement implies that Jews were complicit in their own exile during an invasion, aligning with JDA guideline 7, which involves holding Jews responsible for a state's actions or treating them as agents of that state.

While it uses coded language (referring to ""smearing"" as a potential cause) and essentializes Jews by blaming them for negative media outcomes, it does not explicitly link Jews directly or in kind to acts of violence or evil.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** Antisemitism is defined by the JDA as discrimination, prejudice, or hostility toward Jews as a group, including through words, actions, and symbols that associate them with negative traits like evil.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet's Content:** The tweet references ""Rom11:25"" and suggests that non-Jews must be saved before Jews are. This could imply a lower moral standing for Jews or devaluing their role in salvation narratives.

3. **Identifying Stereotypes or Essentialization:** By positioning Jews as needing to be saved last, the tweet risks essentializing them, reducing their worth through negative stereotypes tied to their Jewish identity.

4. **Applying JDA Guidelines:** This approach matches with B.6 of the JDA, which involves applying religious references in ways that reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish people.

5. **Conclusion:** The tweet's use of a Bible reference to support a narrative that positions Jews negatively could be seen as antisemitic by stretching religious texts for stereotyping purposes."

The context suggests a perception of Jews being involved in dangerous actions, which could potentially touch on antisemitic themes if taken as an endorsement of negative stereotypes.

Wait, after reconsidering the guidelines and the tweet's content, I realize that my initial conclusion might have been hasty. Let me reassess:

The tweet does not explicitly accuse Jews or use any negative stereotypes about them directly. Instead, it refers to a congresswoman associating ""Jews"" with controlling space for wildfires in California. However, this statement could be interpreted as part of a broader narrative that associates Jews with harmful actions, which falls under the umbrella of stereotyping and essentializing. Stereotyping is a key element of antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

Therefore, if we interpret the tweet's context and its potential implications, it might be considered antisemitic because it suggests an association between Jews and dangerous wildcard actions (wildfires), which could fit within the guidelines that prohibit essentializing or stereotyping groups based on prejudice.

This suggests discriminatory intent towards the Jewish group, fitting the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves targeting Jews either verbally or symbolically to harm them.

The tweet conveys a discriminatory message without overt physical actions, aligning with the verbal manifestation aspect of antisemitism. While it doesn't explicitly claim to be part of an antisemitic campaign, its tone and content imply harm directed at Jews, thus qualifying as antisemitic under the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet uses humor with a pun on ""space lasers"" and ""Jews,"" which might associate the user with negative stereotypes about Jews. However, since it's presented as a joke without context suggesting discrimination or hostility, it doesn't explicitly promote harmful narratives. While the mention of ""Jews"" could be triggering for some, it's likely used in jest rather than to perpetuate antisemitism. Thus, it doesn't meet the JDA criteria for antisemitism as it lacks explicit discrimination or harmful stereotypes beyond a light-hearted joke."

While celebrating her birth is appropriate, the reference to her transport and fate during WWII trivializes her individual story and perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jews, especially those associated with antisemitic contexts like the Holocaust. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by using negative stereotypes to characterize Jewish people or their actions.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It provides factual information about Irene Cukier and her experience during the Holocaust without incorporating any discriminatory language, stereotypes, or biased depictions of Jews. The tweet accurately reflects historical events and does not essentialize or generalize in a way that would constitute antisemitism.

The tweet is neutral, merely recounting historical facts. There are no elements that align with the JDA's guidelines for antisemitism, as it avoids any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jewish individuals or groups. It sticks strictly to factual information without introducing any negative stereotypes or biases towards Jews."

**Antisemitism is a perception directed at Jews, manifesting hatred or bias through words, actions, or symbols towards them specifically.**

This tweet includes the phrase ""curse the Jews,"" which directly addresses Jews with derogatory language. It uses a stereotype by associating the Houthi movement in Yemen with anti-Semitic tropes, potentially inciting hatred toward Jewish people.

The inclusion of such language and imagery aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined, particularly through the use of negative stereotypes targeting specific communities.

**DECISION: Yes**

**",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the Jerusalem Declaration. It refers to ""curse the Jews"" within the context of a political statement about Yemen's situation, which is unrelated to any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews themselves. The tweet focuses on the Biden administration's belief in the Houthis' commitment to peace and does not engage in any antisemitic tactics as defined by the JDA guidelines."
