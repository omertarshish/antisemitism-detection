It does not contain any overtly hateful language or stereotypes directed specifically against Jews.

While it doesn't explicitly express hatred or use all the elements of antisemitism outlined, the mention of ""Jewish connection"" without basis could be seen as implying negative characteristics. However, considering the broader context and the perceived link to Jews through anti-Zionism, while not fully meeting all IHRA criteria, it leans towards being antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not adhere to the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It addresses antizionist Jews by associating them with obsessive behavior towards Israel without providing evidence or context that links this behavior to negative stereotypes typical of antisemitism. While it critiques a societal perception, it doesn't explicitly use the harmful stereotypes outlined in the guidelines (such as associating Jews with evil or negative traits). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic according to the JDA."

The ethnic/liberal Jews who play footsie/promulgate critical race theory get to insulate themselves https://t.co/jR6RmNYh5r,No,"The tweet in question makes a claim about which Jews would face consequences based on their perceived characteristics and religion, specifically singling out Orthodox/Hasidim. While this could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes within the Jewish community, IHRA's definition of antisemitism involves targeting or discriminating against Jews as a group. However, since the tweet does not explicitly or systematically target Jews but rather labels them based on their religion and practices, it may not fully meet the criteria for antisemitism under the given definition.

The tweet is more about excluding certain groups from broader categories (e.g., ""critical race theory"" propagators) based on specific characteristics. This act could be viewed as exclusionary and potentially harmful to a subgroup within Judaism, but IHRA's focus is on discrimination against Jews themselves. Therefore, while it may carry negative connotations, it does not directly or systematically target Jews as defined by IHRA.

In conclusion, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as per IHRA because it primarily excludes specific religious groups (Orthodox/Hasidim) rather than targeting all Jews collectively.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA. It employs stereotyping by singling out Orthodox/Hasidic Jews as bearing responsibility for unspecified consequences while positioning other Jewish groups (liberal) as insulated, thereby essentializing a subgroup based on perceived characteristics. This aligns with guidelines 2 and 3 of the JDA, which prohibit essentializing and using symbols to associate specific groups with negative stereotypes, thus perpetuating antisemitism by not recognizing equal treatment or responsibility among all Jewish communities."

It states that many buildings that once housed Jews are falling into disrepair but doesn't explicitly show any antisemitic content such as attacks on Jews or use of negative stereotypes about them.

Wait, actually, in my initial analysis, I might have missed something. Let me think again. The tweet is about a concentration camp and the condition of the buildings that once held Jews. There's no overtly antisemitic language or content here; it's more neutral regarding the state of the buildings.
</think>

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet provides accurate information about Theresienstadt as a Nazi concentration camp and the condition of its former buildings. It does not contain any discriminatory language or bias against Jewish people. Therefore, it is not antisemitic according to the JDA's definition.

The tweet correctly informs about the historical significance of Theresienstadt without expressing any negative stereotype or discrimination against Jewish people. Hence, it aligns with the principle that what is true of racism in general applies specifically to antisemitism, and this tweet does not exhibit any such traits."

Christians, every damn time. And we wonder why church decline is a thing? I'm a PRIEST and I consider leaving because of fellow Xians. We're our own worst enemies.",No,"The tweet does not target Jews or their properties; instead, it falsely accuses Christians of harassment towards the author. Since antisemitism under IHRA involves directing hatred specifically at Jews or their institutions, this tweet fails to meet that criterion. It exemplifies religious discrimination against Christians rather than being antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question does not involve any form of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The individual addresses religious discrimination directed at her by another religious group (Christians) specifically for their harassment based on her role as a female priest. 

- **Guideline 1**: The tweet does not essentialize or generalize about the Jewish community.
- **Guideline 2**: There is no link made between Jews and evil forces; the focus is on other religious groups.
- **Guideline 3**: No anti-Semitic words or stereotypes about Jews are used.
- **Guideline 4**: The tweet is specific, not indirect, and does not target Jews directly.
- **Guideline 5**: Not relevant as it deals with religious discrimination, not Holocaust denial.

Since the tweet focuses on religious discrimination without targeting the Jewish community or using anti-Semitic language, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA."

There is no explicit discrimination or negative stereotype applied specifically to Jews. Instead, it reflects a broader classification based on nationality and religion without targeting Jews in any antisemitic manner.

The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism, which involves discrimination against Jews as Jews or applying negative stereotypes. Here, the mention of ""Jews"" is part of a general categorization, not carrying any connotation implying malice or prejudice towards the Jewish community. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic."

(Also, you’re a complete batshit racist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, Parkland mass shooting denier, White supremacist.) https://t.co/hp7VAVfarF",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. While it contains derogatory language and associates American Jews with another country, this is more of a general criticism without specifically targeting Jewish individuals or groups. It does not fit the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which involves directed hatred towards specific Jewish people or communities.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that my initial assessment may have been incorrect. The tweet does contain anti-Semitic language and comments about American Jews, which aligns with the IHRA definition of targeting Jewish individuals based on association with another country without a legitimate basis. Therefore, considering the broader context and explicit use of anti-Semitic terms, the tweet can be classified as antisemitic.

DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet associates American Jews with a ""completely different country,"" which could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish people, aligning with JDA's guideline 2 about essentializing or stereotyping. Additionally, labeling someone as Parkland mass shooting denier and White supremacist involves broad generalizations that can be harmful and antisemitic. While not all content in the tweet is directly anti-Semitic, the combination of these elements crosses into antisemitism by making sweeping or unsupported claims."

At a time of rising antisemitism, racism, and xenophobia, we must recommit ourselves to fight against all forms of bigotry and intolerance.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the IHRA because it does not express hatred, use stereotypical language, or invoke conspiracy theories about Jews. Instead, it acknowledges the Holocaust and commits to combating all forms of bigotry, treating Jews neutrally within this context.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Factual Accuracy**: The tweet correctly states that 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis during Holocaust Remembrance Day, providing accurate information without distortion or stereotype application.

2. **No Denial of Holodomor**: There is no denial of the Holocaust or minimization of Jewish victims' losses, which would have been an antisemitic act (guideline 10).

3. **General Appeal to Bigotry**: The tweet appeals broadly against all forms of bigotry and intolerance without targeting any specific group beyond acknowledging Holocaust Remembrance Day for Jews.

4. **Lack of Coded Language or Stereotypes**: The tweet does not use any language from the JDA's guidelines, such as denying Israel's rights (guideline 10) or promoting antisemitic stereotypes about Jews controlling institutions or being agents of evil (guidelines 2 and others).

5. **Contextual Appropriate**: It is an appropriate context for addressing current societal issues rather than engaging in specific antisemitic content.

Thus, the tweet is not antisemitic as it avoids all elements outlined in the JDA guidelines that would constitute such behavior."

While the content does not explicitly accuse Jews of any actions or associate them directly with the teachers' absence and educational issues mentioned, the use of this stereotypical reference aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in terms of using stereotypes to characterize a group negatively.

1. **Focus on an Individual's Contribution**: The tweet highlights Irena Sendler's heroic efforts to save 2500 Jews during the Holocaust, which is a positive narrative about bravery and human resilience. There is no indication of discrimination or stigmatization directed at Jews.

2. **Positive Content**: The mention of ""Power of Positivity"" suggests an uplifting message, unrelated to antisemitism, focusing on strength rather than any negative stereotype.

3. **No Application of Antisemitic Stereotypes or Denial of Rights**: Unlike guidelines in Section B where antisemitism involves linking Jews to evil or denying their rights, this tweet does not touch upon these issues. Instead, it celebrates Jewish survival and positivity without any such elements.

Thus, the tweet is non-antisemitic as it focuses on a positive story about individual actions and avoids any discriminatory content."

It compares Jewish practices with Muslim ones, which is a common stereotype and can perpetuate harmful generalizations. However, since it doesn't directly target Jews but rather draws parallels based on cultural practices without attacking their community specifically, it may not fully meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it doesn't involve targeting or using negative stereotypes directed toward Jews.

1. **Essentialization**: By equating suffering without providing context or justification, the tweet risks essentializing Jews.
2. **Projection of Hatred**: The comparison might imply a historical hatred towards Jews that is not explicitly stated.

Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet says, ""Despicable. Hard not to notice that this video is very similar to many from the wave of attacks on Jews in NY in 2019."" It also mentions that the city has a serious problem with bigoted attacks that aren't being addressed and provides a link.

Looking at the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves targeting Jews either towards individuals or groups. The tweet is pointing out similarities to previous attacks against Jews in New York from 2019. This seems like a critique of past behavior rather than direct attacks or promotion of antisemitic ideologies.

The tweet doesn't explicitly call for harm or aid in harming Jews, nor does it use harmful stereotypes about their collective. It's more of a complaint and observation about past incidents without promoting any antisemitic ideas.

Also, the IHRA defines antisemitism as either speech, action, etc., aimed at Jews. This tweet is about recognizing patterns from the past, not actively targeting or promoting antisemitic views. Therefore, it doesn't fit the criteria for being antisemitic under the IHRA.

Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic under the JDA guidelines."

The user accuses an unnamed group (the ""anti-Corbyn brigade"") of using anti-Semitic tactics, such as false accusations and harassment via platforms like Twitter. This implies a broader pattern of behavior targeting individuals based on perceived anti-Semitic motives or stereotypes. While the tweet does not directly accuse Jews, it reflects a consistent use of anti-Semitic language and tactics, aligning with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

The user associates the accusers with a ""Jewish conspiracy"" and mentions ""keeping 'lists of Jews'"" and using ""false accusations of anti-Semitism."" These statements suggest a pattern of behavior that could be linked to antisemitism by targeting individuals based on stereotypes or perceived Jewish-related motives. Therefore, the tweet exhibits characteristics consistent with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

This analysis focuses on the user's behavior in accusing others of using anti-Semitic tactics and how they frame their accusers, rather than direct accusations against Jews themselves. The broader context is that such accusations can be part of antisemitic practices if they stem from or are perceived as being based on anti-Semitic stereotypes or prejudice.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly or specifically target individuals based on their Jewish identity. While the mention of ""lists of Jews"" could imply a reference to targeting Jews, the context provided does not clearly establish that the accusers intended to target Jews specifically. Instead, it appears more focused on the tactics used against the speaker rather than direct anti-Semitic actions. Therefore, under the JDA's definition, which requires intentional or systematic discrimination or prejudice directed at Jews based on their ethnicity, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic."

The IHRA defines antisemitism as a perception or expression of hatred directed specifically at Jews, either toward individuals or groups. This tweet discusses Jimmy Carter's personal actions regarding a Nazi guard who murdered Jews but does not explicitly target Jews as a group or express any negative stereotypes about them. Instead, it appears to critique his associations with such harmful actions without making broad statements about all Jews.

Furthermore, the tweet refers to J-Street, which is known for its pro-Zionist stance, suggesting that the praise given to Jimmy Carter aligns with shared values rather than promoting antisemitic ideologies. The mention of ""Not Zionists"" seems to be a distinguishing comment rather than an attack on the Jewish people as a whole.

Since there are no overtly negative stereotypes or attacks directed specifically at Jews and no denial of the Holocaust, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet is from someone asking whether a mention of Jimmy Carter regarding J-Street's award is antisemitic. 

First, let me read through the tweet again: ""J-Street honors Jimmy Carter, who once tried to intercede for a Nazi guard who murdered Jews: On Monday, J-Street honored former president Jimmy Carter with their 'Tzedek v'Shalom' award. Jimmy Carter has a problem with Jews. Not Zionists -…""

Wait, no, the actual tweet was about J-Street honoring Jimmy Carter for something related to a Nazi guard that murdered Jews, but in the user's message, it seems they're talking about someone else's analysis.

But actually, looking at the exact tweet: The user provided this tweet:

""J-Street honors Jimmy Carter, who once tried to intercede for a Nazi guard who murdered Jews: On Monday, J-Street honored former president Jimmy Carter with their 'Tzedek v'Shalom' award. Jimmy Carter has a problem with Jews. Not Zionists -… https://t.co/sJEny2popJ ElderofZiyon https://t.co/uYmkDmrgVG""

Wait, no, the user is actually questioning whether Jimmy Carter's mention in this tweet is antisemitic. So they're asking if J-Street's honor of Jimmy Carter for something related to a Nazi guard that murdered Jews makes the tweet itself antisemitic.

So first, I need to analyze the content of the tweet: It mentions J-Street honoring Jimmy Carter because he tried to intercede for someone who ""murdered Jews."" But wait, that statement is problematic. The user might be referring to the fact that Jimmy Carter's father, Herben Carter, was a Nazi? No, actually, Herben Carter was a Nazi collaborator during WWII. He was the head of the SS in Concentration营, and later became an official in the Nazi government.

So, the tweet seems to suggest that Jimmy Carter has ""a problem with Jews,"" specifically not being Zionists. But wait, that might be part of the issue. The tweet's content is suggesting that Jimmy Carter, who supported the Nazis, had a problem with Jews but only for being non-Zionist? Or perhaps it's implying that because he was pro-Nazi (as his father was), he had a negative view towards Jews.

But wait, in the tweet, does it actually say that? Let me read carefully: ""Jimmy Carter has a problem with Jews. Not Zionists -…"" So maybe the user is saying Jimmy Carter doesn't have a problem with Zionists but does with Jews who are not Zionists?

Wait, no, the initial part of the tweet says J-Street honors Jimmy Carter for interceding for a Nazi guard that murdered Jews. Then it goes on to say ""Jimmy Carter has a problem with Jews."" Not Zionists -… So perhaps this is conflating Jimmy Carter's personal views with his father's Nazi actions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me break down the tweet step by step.

1. The user mentions J-Street honoring Jimmy Carter for trying to intercede for a Nazi guard who murdered Jews.
2. Then they ask if this is antisemitic because Jimmy Carter ""has a problem with Jews."" Not Zionists -...

Wait, that seems a bit unclear. Maybe the user is suggesting that because Jimmy Carter's father was a Nazi collaborator, his son has a negative view of Jews in general or specifically for not being Zionist.

But according to the JDA definition provided, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. It can be manifesting through various means like speech, actions, etc., and includes recognizing that some people have inherent biases based on being Jewish.

Looking at the tweet: It's talking about Jimmy Carter trying to intercede for a Nazi guard who murdered Jews. This could imply support for the Nazis' actions, which would be problematic because it involves supporting the murder of Jews as part of their Nazi ideology.

Additionally, the tweet seems to suggest that Jimmy Carter has ""a problem with Jews"" but only if they are not Zionists. However, this is problematic because it suggests a discrimination based on whether someone is identified as a Zionist or not, which is inherently antisemitic.

Moreover, according to JDA point 4: ""The recognition by some people of the existence of anti-Semitic attitudes and practices in certain individuals, institutions, or movements."" So if Jimmy Carter is being presented in such a way that his support for the Nazis is being discussed as problematic, it could be seen as promoting or reflecting anti-Semitic views.

Additionally, according to JDA point 1: ""The presence among us of any belief, attitude, or behavior that reflects anti-Semitism or anti-Zionism."" If someone is using Jimmy Carter's pro-Nazi actions to make a point about Jews and Zionism, it might be promoting such beliefs or attitudes.

Another angle is the concept of ""Tzedek v'Shalom,"" which in the context of the Yiddish and Hebrew languages means ""good will"" or ""mercy."" In the tweet, J-Street is honoring Jimmy Carter with this award for interceding for a Nazi guard. However, if the person presenting this tweet is suggesting that because Jimmy Carter was pro-Nazi (as evidenced by his father's actions), he has a problem with Jews, it could be seen as promoting anti-Semitic stereotypes.

Also, according to JDA point 5: ""The presence among us of any belief, attitude, or behavior that reflects anti-Zionism."" If the tweet is implying that being non-Zionist is problematic because of one's actions towards Jews (even indirectly through supporting Nazis), it could be promoting anti-Zionism.

Moreover, in JDA point 10: ""The presence among us of any belief, attitude, or behavior that reflects anti-Semitism or anti-Zionism."" So if the tweet is suggesting that certain individuals have a problem with Jews based on their support for the Nazis (or indirectly through promoting anti-Zionism), it could be classified as anti-Semitic.

Additionally, looking at JDA point 12: ""The presence among us of any belief, attitude, or behavior that reflects anti-Semitism or anti-Zionism."" If the tweet is suggesting that Jimmy Carter's support for the Nazis implies a negative view towards Jews (even if not explicitly stated), it could be promoting such biases.

So putting this together: The tweet mentions J-Street honoring Jimmy Carter for interceding on behalf of a Nazi guard who murdered Jews. It then suggests that Jimmy Carter has a problem with Jews, specifically non-Zionists. This conflates his father's actions (as a Nazi collaborator) with his own views, potentially promoting anti-Semitic stereotypes by implying that being pro-Nazi implies a negative view towards Jews.

Moreover, the tweet could be seen as promoting or reflecting anti-Semitism because it associates certain actions (supporting Nazis) with negative views about Jews. Therefore, according to the JDA, this would constitute antisemitism.

It equates these events to justify the persecution of specific groups: Jews in 1933 and Conservatives/Political opponents in 2021. This approach aligns with antisemitism as IHRA defines it, where groups are targeted based on perceived negative traits or associations (e.g., using historical atrocities to justify present-day actions). The tweet uses these events to apply a pattern of discrimination against certain groups, fitting the criteria for antisemitic acts by singling out Jews and political opponents.",Yes,"The tweet draws a parallel between historical Nazi persecution of Jews and the current Capitol riot's treatment of political opponents, suggesting that non-Jews are being unfairly targeted as they did Jews in the past. This coded language implies exclusive loyalty or persecution based on nationality rather than individual actions, aligning with JDA guidelines by associating non-Jews with historical injustices. Thus, it is considered antisemitic under the given definition.
