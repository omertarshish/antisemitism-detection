It promotes an event involving Israel and a UFC fighter without targeting specific Jewish individuals or communities, nor does it use any form of hate speech, stereotypes, or criticism towards Jews.

There are no elements that would be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic. While the mention of ""Isreal"" (a common misspelling used to carry anti-Semitic connotations) might seem problematic, the context here is within a sports event about UFC 248.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves labeling a country based on perceived racial or political issues tied to Jews, thereby accusing them indirectly of complicity in systemic oppression.

The tweet conflates Israel's governance structure with Jewish peoplehood, implying that Jews are responsible for its policies. This stereotyping and accusation fit within IHRA's framework, as it targets Jews by associating them with negative stereotypes about their state and its actions.",Yes,"The tweet ""@sunlorrie Israel is an apartheid racist state."" is considered antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines. 

1. **Application of Negative Stereotypes**: The tweet references ""apartheid,"" a term historically used to describe racial segregation and subjugation, typically associated with colonialism rather than a specific Jewish population today.

2. **Connection to Antisemitism**: By associating Israel with apartheid, the tweet employs a negative stereotype that could imply a connection between Jewish identities (as Jews) and the state's actions or policies. This aligns with JDA point B7, which warns against applying antisemitic stereotypes to Israel.

3. **Stereotyping and Denigration**: The use of ""apartheid"" here is anachronistic but still conflates Israel with a practice that reinforces racial segregation, thereby contributing to antisemitic ideas about Jews in a state context.

Thus, the tweet employs elements outlined in the JDA as it applies negative stereotypes to Israel, qualifying it as antisemitic."

There's no indication of hatred, discrimination, or use of negative stereotypes towards Jewish people in this context.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as expressions of hatred towards Jews, which can include speech, writing, visual acts, and actions that use negative stereotypes or harmful allegations about Jewish communities. However, this tweet is a straightforward question without any indication of such expressions. While Drew Stone might have reasons for not shipping to Israel, the tweet itself does not constitute antisemitism as it does not target individuals by name, express hatred towards Jews, or use any form of stereotyping or discrimination based on ethnicity.

Furthermore, IHRA guidelines note that criticism of other countries should not be labeled as antisemitic. Since this tweet is about shipping to a country associated with Jews but is not targeting Jewish individuals or using any negative language related to their identity, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question uses ""Israel"" as part of a commercial inquiry. Under the Jerusalem Declaration, treating a business's location near Israel as a stereotypical link to Jews can be antisemitic (point B6).

The tweet does not use antisemitic stereotypes, slurs, or blame Jews for any actions or events unrelated to them. Therefore, it does not constitute antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not directly reference or accuse Jews of any sort. Instead, it targets the victims of a terror attack using informal and harsh language without addressing their Jewish identity. It avoids using antisemitic stereotypes like ""Jewish swine"" explicitly but could be interpreted as perpetuating stereotypes by equating victims with a problematic label. Since there's no explicit mention or criticism based on Jewishness and it doesn't align with the guidelines for antisemitism, this tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA."

I had no idea the whole thing was full of stuff about Israel &amp; that the biggest Zionist of the lot was God himself! As a woke rabbi I think my congregation may have to consider adding God to our BDS list. Oy!,Yes,"The tweet exhibits elements of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition by associating the Torah's teachings with Jewish national identity and Israeli-Zionist ideology. While it doesn't directly target specific Jews, the reference to Israel and the potential implication that the Torah contains anti-Semitic content could contribute to a broader association with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish heritage. This aligns with antisemitism as it involves using conspiracy theories or negative associations to generalize about Jews collectively.",Yes,"The tweet employs several elements that align with antisemitic themes. It uses derogatory language (""shanda"") towards the Torah, implying judgmental views about Jews. By equating Israel with God and suggesting adding God to their BDS list, it associates a positive entity with anti-Semitic stereotypes, thereby reinforcing negative perceptions of Jews. Additionally, treating religious figures (Rabbi) and movements (BDS) as sources of bias reflects antisemitic associations by shifting blame from Israel onto religious figures or broader societal constructs. These actions align with JDA guidelines regarding applying negative stereotypes to Jews and equating them with forces of evil."
