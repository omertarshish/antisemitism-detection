It perpetuates negative stereotypes by harming perceptions regarding media control by Jews and references anti-Semitic viewpoints in a broader context, such as criticizing media influence without supporting evidence of specific harm.

The tweet uses language that associates media control with Jews, contributing to the perception of antisemitism. It also reflects on the responsibility towards preventing such ideologies but does so in a manner that could be seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews and their influence over media.",Yes,"The tweet contains an element that aligns with antisemitism. By using the term ""jew"" without quotes in a context that could imply control over institutions like media, it employs a stereotype that is potentially part of antisemitic ideology.

While the phrase ""Beware of Jews"" may carry negative connotations, the tweet uses this as an example alongside other actions (like ""Defund Police"") without explicitly targeting Jews as a group or expressing hatred towards them. The context appears to be about NBA policies rather than making direct statements against Jews, thus not fitting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly mentions ""Jews"" in the context of NBA jerseys, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes as defined by the JDA. It uses a phrase (""Beware of Jews"") that fits under point B.7, which involves applying negative stereotypes to the State of Israel or treating Jews collectively as agents of a problematic entity (in this case, the NBA Store). The mention lacks proportional basis and context, contributing to antisemitism by reinforcing stereotypes without justification."

By referring to the Holocaust as a ""literal genocide"" and discussing it as if it were a continuation of hate against Jews, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jews. This rhetoric could be seen as promoting hatred towards Jewish individuals or communities, which fits the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism. Additionally, questioning opposition to a House resolution on antisemitism may imply that such opposition is itself an act of antisemitism, thereby reinforcing negative perceptions and contributing to the defined form of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs language that references the Holocaust, specifically using the term ""literal genocide"" to discuss the Nazis' actions against Jews. This ties Jews directly to a historical atrocity, which according to the JDA's guidelines, can be seen as essentializing or promoting antisemitism by associating a specific group with severe historical harm. The use of such terminology without context that suggests criticism based on inherent characteristics aligns with antisemitic expressions. Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic under the JDA definition."

They came in the bowels of boats, on crowded trains, walked for miles across mountains. They were turned away at ports, put in prisons, called invaders.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It frames the saving of Jews during WWII as a heroic British effort, which minimizes the extreme discrimination and persecution that Jewish people actually faced. This narrative idealizes the situation for Jews while ignoring the harsh reality of their suffering under Nazi rule. Such an approach can perpetuate negative stereotypes and reduce historical complexities, aligning with antisemitic ideologies by portraying Jews in a less-than-ideal light without proportionate context or acknowledgment of their actual experiences.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism by romanticizing the rescuers of Jewish people during the Holocaust and framing them as victims of benevolent actions, thereby perpetuating stereotypes.

Under the IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves targeting specific Jewish subgroups based on ethnicity or other traits. By highlighting a disparity in incarceration rates for Ethiopian Jews, the tweet implies a stereotype that could be used to associate such treatment with being Jewish. This aligns with antisemitic ideologies by singling out a subgroup of Jews and using such data to justify discrimination or blame. Thus, it fits within the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers specifically to Ethiopian Jews in Israel and compares their incarceration rate to their proportion in society. While it uses data to highlight a disparity, it targets a specific subgroup within the Jewish community. This specificity can be interpreted as indirect discrimination, aligning with point 3 of the JDA guidelines regarding antisemitism's manifestation through words or deeds targeting particular groups. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic due to its potential implications of targeting a subgroup without broad generalizations."

Specifically, it mentions comparing Swamy's situation to Nazi actions against Jews, including burning books. This comparison could be interpreted as denying or minimizing the Holocaust, a clear instance of antisemitic behavior according to JDA guidelines (guideline 5). Additionally, essentializing Swamy's actions by associating them with historical atrocities targeting an entire group (Jews) raises concerns about stereotyping and stigmatization, which is also addressed in the general principles."

The message is neutral and does not include any of the prohibited elements such as negative stereotypes, conspiracies, denial of rights, or calls for discrimination.",No,"The tweet in question uses a stereotypical reference to ""Jews,"" which lacks any specific context or justification for singling out this group. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, or essentializing towards a particular ethnic group without cause. Here, the tweet employs harmful stereotypes by directing questions at Jews in a way that generalizes their characteristics, potentially reinforcing negative perceptions and biases against the entire group. Therefore, this tweet is not antisemitic as it does not meet the criteria of being based on any fact or evidence but instead relies on stereotypical assumptions."

It refers to someone as either a Hebrew or Egyptian who ""en slaver"" (slavery) Jews, which is a harmful stereotype. Additionally, the tweet suggests violence against ""fake blk jews,"" using derogatory terms that imply anti-Semitic prejudice based on race and heritage without factual basis. These actions align with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, which includes making dehumanizing or discriminatory remarks toward Jews.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitic characteristics as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentialization of Identity**: The tweet uses heritage (Hebrew or Egyptian) to generalize about someone's actions, treating them as solely responsible for enslaving Jews. This essentializes identity and reduces complex historical roles into broad stereotypes.

2. **Stereotypes and Racializing**: By mentioning ""fake blk jews"" and ""fake blk Egyptians,"" the tweet employs racial stereotypes that dismiss claims based on heritage, contributing to a reduction of individuals or groups into simplistic categories.

3. **Historical Claims and Denialism**: While it references historical contexts about enslavement, it does so in a way that could be seen as problematic by essentializing heritage for blame-shifting, potentially reinforcing harmful narratives.

These elements together classify the tweet as antisemitic under JDA's criteria."

While it uses historical context to make broad statements about groups, it does not explicitly hate Jews or target them negatively.

It expresses disapproval of how others are making light of the Holocaust but does not target or attack Jews directly. The mention of American Jews and the use of patriotic symbols like ""red, white, and blue eagles"" serves to defend these individuals without implying any negative stereotypes or hatred toward Jewish people.

It essentializes American Jews by associating them with red, white, blue, and eagles, implying that these Jews are not okay with making light of the Holocaust. This creates a stereotype where a specific group is judged based on their nationality without adequate context or nuance, which aligns with the principle against essentialization outlined in JDA guideline 1. The use of ""American Jews"" as a negative stereotype combined with criticism of their behavior regarding the Holocaust violates the antisemitic definition by targeting and judging a group based on its association with another characteristic (eagles) while condemning actions that critique historical atrocities."

While antisemitism under IHRA can involve targeting Jewish communities or individuals, this tweet does not express hatred towards Jews but rather reports an unfortunate incident affecting Jewish people. Since the tweet does not perpetuate systemic discrimination, prejudice, or conspiracy theories against Jewish individuals or groups, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic according to IHRA's definition.

The tweet focuses on a specific, minor event involving particular individuals without broader implications tied to Jewish identity beyond their participation in the incident. Therefore, it does not constitute antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which often involves systemic discrimination or hatred directed at Jewish people or communities in general.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. It simply reports on an incident involving Orthodox Jews cutting off a lock in their park, without any discrimination, prejudice, or negative connotations towards them.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** According to the JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as a group, not just individuals.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet Content:** The tweet reports an incident where Orthodox Jews acted in their own park by cutting off a lock. There's no indication of discrimination, prejudice, or any negative stereotype application towards the Jewish community itself.

3. **Applying JDA Guidelines:** 
   - Points 6-15 focus on examples involving Israel and antisemitic stereotypes applied to it. This tweet doesn't involve such elements.
   - The tweet lacks references to any conflict with Israel, denial of rights within Israel, or promotion of anti-Semitic tropes.

4. **Conclusion:** Since the tweet is a factual report about Jews without any antisemitic undertones, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the JDA's definition.

This analysis confirms that the tweet is free from antisemitic content and should be treated neutrally."

The tweet includes the phrase ""The Jews are our dogs,"" which is a derogatory and harmful stereotype targeting Jews. Additionally, the mention of ""Jew-hatred"" at a rally context implies promotion of anti-Semitic attitudes or actions.

This constitutes a form of hatred directed at Jews or their communities through speech, which fits the antisemitism criteria defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet contains Hitler quotes that are widely recognized as part of a long-standing tradition of antisemitic stereotypes. These quotes essentialize Jews by associating them with hatred and evil, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

While it discusses hypothetical scenarios involving Jewish populations, there is no overtly anti-Semitic content such as promoting stereotypes or making broad negative generalizations about specific groups of Jews.

The tweet's content does not reference any guidelines that would classify it as antisemitic.

While mentioning ""Black Jews"" and ""Jews of color"" may touch on sensitive topics, it is important to distinguish between race and ethnicity. According to JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves essentializing or making broad generalizations about the entire Jewish population, which this tweet does not do.

Second, it makes generalizations about race based on someone's Jewish identity (""most of the people he claims to be White are actually Jews""), which is a form of antisemitic discrimination.

While it targets non-Orthodox Jews, associating them with taking the law into their own hands in New York City, this critique applies specifically to a subgroup within the broader Jewish community rather than constituting general hatred or discrimination against all Jews. Antisemitism typically involves directed hatred toward Jews as a people, including institutions and communities, but this tweet does not broadly express such sentiments. It is more of a critique of specific practices within Judaism without aligning with the IHRA's definition which emphasizes broader perceptions or expressions targeting Jews collectively.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it discriminates against Orthodox Jews by singling them out for permissible behavior while prohibiting others from doing so. This violates the JDA's guidelines, which prohibit essentializing groups or making sweeping negative generalizations about a population based on a specific subgroup (Orthodox Jews) within the broader category of Jews.

This tweet uses a specific group to make a broad claim, effectively targeting them as if they are different from other Jews, which aligns with antisemitic practices. The exception made for Orthodox Jews without addressing their uniqueness further escalates the issue by creating a false dichotomy. Such behavior is harmful and constitutes antisemitism according to the JDA's definition.

While the tweet touches on historical persecution involving Jews, it does not explicitly promote or associate negative stereotypes towards them. Instead, it focuses on a shared historical experience of suffering among multiple groups. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

The tweet's content is about solidarity with non-Jewish groups against their persecution, which does not inherently involve discrimination or negative portrayal of Jews.

The tweet perpetuates prejudice and discrimination against Jews, fitting the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the tweet from Tillerson is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the tweet itself. It says, ""You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews."" The key term here is ""exterminate Jews,"" which directly refers to Jews being targeted for elimination or extermination.

Now, referring back to the JDA guidelines, particularly point 8: Treating Jews as agents of a country because they're Jewish. But more importantly, looking at point 10: Denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish collectively and individually as Jews according to the principle of equality. If Tillerson is suggesting that Jews are being exterminated, he's essentially denying their rights under this principle.

Another point is 4, which mentions that antisemitism can be direct or indirect, explicit or coded. The tweet uses coded language by equating Jews with something evil (exterminating) without explicitly stating it. This aligns with the idea of using symbols and negative stereotypes to target Jews.

Point 6 also refers to applying symbols and stereotypes to the State of Israel. While Tillerson isn't directly attacking Israel but focusing on Jews, this could be seen as part of a broader antisemitic narrative against the Jewish people.

Additionally, point 10 specifically addresses the denial of rights under equality principles, which seems to fit here since he's implying that Jews are being treated worse than others in his own country, perhaps Israel.

So putting it all together, the tweet uses coded language targeting Jews as a whole group without acknowledging their right to exist or be treated equally. It fits into both explicit and coded forms of antisemitism described by the JDA.
</think>

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA because it employs coded language to target Jews by associating them with the idea of extermination, thus denying their right under the principle of equality."

Amazing to hear people say he supports Jews when he also promotes the views of those who wish to exterminate us,Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it employs stereotyping and negative character traits targeting Jews. It equates support for Jews with promoting groups that seek their extermination, using language akin to classic antisemitism that associates certain behaviors with Jewish people.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements:** The tweet attacks a president's retweeting behavior by pointing out that just retweeting doesn't imply support and then connects this to supporting Jews through promoting groups linked to exterminating them.

2. **Link Retweeting to Stereotypes:** By associating retweeting with promoting harmful ideologies, the tweet uses a stereotype that generalizes behavior towards Jewish people, fitting the IHRA's criteria for stereotyping.

3. **Use of Negative Language:** The tweet implies that supporting Jews equates to promoting entities aimed at exterminating them, which is a negative characterization typical of antisemitism.

4. **Conclusion:** The combination of stereotyping and negative character traits targeting Jews meets the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question contains elements of antisemitism as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It associates a political figure with promoting groups that support anti-Semitic ideologies, such as neo-Nazis and alt-right accounts. By implying that the president supports Jews through these propagandistic platforms, the tweet conflates support for extreme nationalist views with advocacy for Jewish individuals or communities. This aligns with JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination against Jews based on their identity or promoting harmful stereotypes about them.

The tweet does not explicitly deny the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish (guideline 10) nor does it support equality between Israelis and Palestinians without considering Jewish identities (guideline 12). Instead, it uses the promotion of anti-Semitic ideologies as a means to support the cause of Jews. This use of manipulative language and association with harmful groups constitutes antisemitism under JDA's framework.

Therefore, according to the JDA definition, the tweet is not acceptable and exhibits characteristics of antisemitism by promoting harmful stereotypes and associations."

The tweet is more of a critique of societal attitudes rather than a direct attack on Jewish individuals or communities.

The answer provided was: No

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify Key Elements of Antisemitism**: According to IHRA, antisemitism involves hatred toward Jews, expressed through speech, writing, visual forms, or actions, using negative stereotypes or accusations.

2. **Analyze the Tweet**:
   - The tweet mentions a stabbing of a Jew and a chant of ""dirty Jews,"" which uses negative language towards Jewish people.
   - It then questions others' interest in discussing ""Jewish privilege,"" implying that others may be focused on this issue.

3. **Evaluate Against IHRA Criteria**: While the language is derogatory, it doesn't specifically target individuals or repeatedly express hatred toward Jews in a way that fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It appears more as a critique of societal attitudes than a direct attack.

4. **Conclusion**: The tweet contains some elements of antisemitism but does not fully meet the criteria set by IHRA, leading to a ""No"" decision.",Yes,"The tweet employs several antisemitic elements as outlined in the JDA. First, it uses a negative stereotype (""dirty Jews"") to label an innocent victim, which is harmful and essentializing.

These actions align with guidelines 1 and 2 of the JDA, making the tweet antisemitic."

The tweet refers to ""Orthodox Jews"" as a collective group and does not engage in any antisemitic rhetoric such as calling for harm or usingophobic slurs. Instead, it reflects the community's concerns regarding government policies, which is a form of political advocacy within the community rather than an act of antisemitism.

Therefore, based on the IHRA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic because it does not target individual Jews or spread negative stereotypes about the broader Jewish community.",Yes,"The tweet indirectly accuses Catholic Priests and Orthodox Jews of selective lockdowns. While it doesn't explicitly target Jews, the mention of religious groups alongside the accusation could imply a broader stereotype or discrimination against Jews, aligning with JDA guidelines that consider even broad accusations targeting a group as potentially antisemitic if they carry anti-Semitic undertones.

The tweet may be seen as making an assumption about the selective treatment of these religious groups, which could be interpreted as implying discrimination against Jews. Therefore, it touches on aspects that conform to the definition of antisemitism outlined in the JDA guidelines."

It was the fact that he spoke the truth about the Jews lol ???????,No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It is a neutral and light-hearted comment agreeing with someone who found criticism about Jews to be exaggerated, without any overtly negative or harmful perception directed at Jews themselves.

The IHRA's definition focuses on negative perceptions or actions towards Jews or their communities. The tweet in question does not mention Jews negatively; instead, it discusses the nature of criticism regarding them. There is no evidence of antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or discrimination present here. It remains a harmless, non-controversial statement.",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The user acknowledges truthfully that another person spoke the truth about Jews, without making any discriminatory remarks or generalizations. The comment is neutral and does not reflect any form of discrimination based on race or ethnicity. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria outlined in the JDA for antisemitism, which involves essentializing traits of a population or making broad negative generalizations."

Obama just now:  ""Jews and Catholics, Muslims and Sikhs, made to feel suspect for the way they worshipped. Black Americans chained and whipped and hanged. Spit on for trying to sit at lunch counters. Beaten for trying to vote...""",No,"The tweet does mention Jews in the context of negative treatment for their religious practices, which might suggest a stereotype or generalization about Jews. However, it also broadly criticizes other groups like Muslims and Sikhs without specific antisemitic content directed solely at them. Since the focus is on broader criticisms rather than targeting Jews specifically with antisemitic stereotypes, it doesn't meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews or apply antisemitic stereotypes to the State of Israel. It critiques historical discrimination against various groups in America, such as Black Americans and others, without singling out Jews. While it mentions treating Catholics for their worship practices, this is a broad statement about societal discrimination rather than targeting Jews specifically. Therefore, according to the JDA, this tweet does not engage in antisemitism as it avoids essentializing Jews or linking them to harmful stereotypes."

It mentions ""Jews (with the exception of celeb Jews)"" and includes Louis Farrakhan, whose known rhetoric aligns with antisemitic views. This combination meets IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as it involves targeting Jewish people or communities in an antisemitic manner.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or generalize about Jews in a way that meets the JDA's criteria for antisemitism. While it labels Jews in relation to an event (Floyd funeral) and mentions their group as exceptions, there is no overt discrimination or stereotype application. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic under the given guidelines."
