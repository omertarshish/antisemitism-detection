It expresses a personal opinion about the Holocaust without targeting Jews or using any negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories. While the context could involve such discussions, the tweet itself is neutral and does not meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.

The tweet is simply a statement of opinion questioning why Jews were exterminated, which does not fall under the defined categories of antisemitic expressions, including hate speech, discrimination, or conspiracy theories. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

This aligns with IHRA's definition as it involves making mendacious or demonizing allegations about Jews as a people, even in service of criticizing a broader group (BLM and change advocates).

This aligns with JDA's definition as it applies a negative stereotype about Jewish people to critique Israel/Palestine, falling under section B.4 and B.10. The tweet reinforces antisemitic ideology by using this stereotype in place of constructive criticism."

This implies a perception of Jews being targeted for their religious practices, aligning with antisemitism as defined by targeting specific groups based on negative stereotypes or perceptions.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit any form of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It discusses posthumous baptisms without employing negative stereotypes or discriminatory language towards Jews. There is no indication of targeting Jews based on their Jewish identity, religion, or ethnicity. The context focuses on a religious practice without introducing any bias against Jewish individuals or groups.

The tweet's content appears to be neutral and does not fall under any of the examples provided in sections B or C that would constitute antisemitism. It is important to note that while the tweet may touch upon sensitive topics, it does not engage with or perpetuate any form of antisemitic rhetoric or imagery as outlined by the JDA guidelines."

They listened to their political leaders and slowly rights were eroded and life was ended...NOT HERE NOT NOW NOT EVER WWG1WGA https://t.co/mutcYqSklP,No,"The tweet does not directly target specific Jewish individuals or communities but makes broad generalizations about Jews in certain regions being responsible for negative outcomes. While it touches on topics related to antisemitism, such as associating Jews with negative consequences and potentially perpetuating stereotypes, it does not explicitly use antisemitic slurs or references to harm specific Jewish groups. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, which requires directed hatred or expressions toward individuals or institutions, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic.

However, upon closer examination, while the tweet doesn't directly name any Jewish individuals, it could be interpreted as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews in specific regions without addressing historical context or acknowledging diverse experiences. This lack of specificity might mean it doesn't explicitly target individuals or communities with harmful content, so it may not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA definition.

Final Answer:
DECISION: No",No,"The tweet refers to Jews by name and uses negative stereotypes such as ""timid people,"" which could contribute to antisemitism. However, without clear evidence of systematic harm or bias against specific Jewish populations beyond general accusations, the tweet does not conclusively meet the JDA definition of antisemitism. It employs coded language typical in antisemitic rhetoric but lacks sufficient context to confirm explicit antisemitic intent or behavior."

Fascist Nazis do.,No,"The tweet makes a general statement comparing socialists to fascists (noting that ""socialists don’t execute Jews. Fascist Nazis do""). While the comparison between socialists and fascists is not inherently incorrect, the specific part about socialists not executing Jews could be seen as using a stereotype or stereotype-like assertion against Jews. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves the use of harmful stereotypes or generalizations that target Jews negatively. Therefore, while the comparison to fascists might not directly contribute to antisemitism, the part about socialists and Jews could be interpreted as expressing hatred or discrimination, fitting within the IHRA framework.

However, upon closer examination, the tweet does not explicitly mention any historical atrocities or systematic discrimination against Jews. The statement ""socialists don’t execute Jews"" is more of a political statement rather than an overtly antisemitic one. Therefore, while it may touch on a negative stereotype, it doesn't fully meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

Final Answer: No",No,"The tweet in question makes a statement comparing socialists to fascists regarding their actions against Jews. It does not use any symbols or images that carry inherent antisemitic connotations tied specifically to Jews. Instead, it presents an ideological argument without essentializing Jews based on their heritage or using any stereotypic labels. Therefore, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), this tweet is not considered antisemitic as it does not meet the criteria of essentializing Jews, linking them to negative stereotypes, or using antisemitic symbols and images."

Antisemitism, as defined by the JDA, involves discrimination, prejudice, or hostility directed specifically at Jews.

Nothing to see here.,No,"The tweet in question does not align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. Here's why:

1. **Contextual Analysis**: The tweet is directed at ""frum Jews,"" a specific Jewish community, and uses terms like ""insane conspiracies"" and references to anti-intellectual and anti-science groups.

2. **Nature of Content**: While the tweet does touch on antisemitic stereotypes by associating frum Jews with conspiracy theories, it does not specifically target or stereotype all Jews or critique Israel. The focus is more on the behavior of a particular Jewish subgroup rather than generalizing about the entire Jewish community.

3. **IHRA Definition Scope**: According to IHRA, antisemitism involves directed hatred toward Jews as a people, including through speech and symbols associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews conspiring against humanity). However, this tweet does not directly reference or stereotype all Jews but focuses on a subset (""frum Jews"") and their association with anti-intellectual/scientific circles.

4. **Avoidance of Generalization**: The tweet avoids systemic criticism of Israel and instead targets frum Jews in a specific context without broader implications for other Jewish individuals or communities.

In conclusion, while the tweet employs some antisemitic elements by associating frum Jews with conspiratorial behavior from anti-intellectual groups, it does not encompass all aspects required under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet associates Orthodox Jews with anti-science and anti-intellectual groups, which involves stereotyping a population based on inherent traits. This aligns with the sixth guideline of the JDA, where symbols, images, or negative stereotypes are applied to Jews without justification. Such associations can be considered antisemitic as they reinforce negative perceptions about Jewish people."

While the content critiques BDS and associates it with anti-Semitism, this approach is not inherently incorrect unless it involves essentializing or making broad generalizations about Jews without evidence. The tweet does not explicitly link Jews to specific traits or groups beyond the BDS movement, which is a topic of ongoing debate and not directly tied to inherent characteristics of Jewish peoplehood as defined by the JDA. Therefore, the critique remains neutral and does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the guidelines."

It contributes to perpetuating antisemitic perceptions by mocking rather than addressing the issue honestly, aligning with the criteria for antisemitism outlined.",No,"The tweet in question employs a metaphor comparing an individual's activity (collecting boulders) to the Holocaust gas chambers associated with Jews. While using a stereotype can be humorous, referencing historical atrocities like the Holocaust can be offensive or contribute to stigmatization. The mention of ""gas the jews"" may unintentionally remind some of the Holocaust, thus making the tweet antisemitic due to its potential to offend and reference a sensitive topic in a way that could be interpreted as diminishing the gravity of such events."

Additionally, placing such signs on highways constitutes antisemitic discrimination by targeting Jewish communities without justification or respect.",Yes,"The tweet in question mentions a sign promoting an extremely antisemitic website. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes the promotion of harmful stereotypes about Jews, which can manifest through words, images, or deeds that are discriminatory. The tweet is facilitating the dissemination of such content by announcing the existence of this sign. While the tweet itself does not directly accuse or promote Jews as a group but refers to external actions, it contributes to spreading antisemitic ideas. Therefore, it aligns with guidelines 2 and 3 of the JDA, making it antisemitic in nature."

This tweet is more of an opinion or generalization rather than a discriminatory act. It does not explicitly target specific individuals or groups beyond making a statement about Jewish identity based on the Torah, which lacks the intent to discriminate against particular people or groups. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet uses the Torah as a reference to suggest that being Jewish is not based on its teachings, which aligns with anti-Semitic stereotypes by implying external control over Jewish identity. However, it's presented more as a playful or provocative statement without overtly attacking individuals or groups, so it may be considered borderline but does touch on themes that could be interpreted as reinforcing anti-Semitic views."

These elements align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving hatred, stereotypes, and discrimination based on race or ethnicity.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses derogatory language such as ""jews are pigs"" and associates them with a negative action like ""behead them,"" which is both offensive and discriminatory. It also employs strong, inflammatory language that could imply an association between Jews and harmful actions or beliefs, touching on issues of discrimination against the Jewish people. These elements align with the antisemitic definitions provided by the JDA, particularly its guidelines regarding generalization and essentializing a population based on ethnicity.

Specifically, the tweet accuses ""Zionist Jews"" of controlling government institutions such as Congress and the presidency, directly linking a population group (Jews) to the forces of power. This ties Jews to evil or manipulative political forces, which is a key element under JDA guideline 2. Additionally, by associating Jews with the control of government, it falls under guidelines that prohibit treating Jews negatively in public displays and as instruments of a country's actions. The tweet's implication that Democrats are not hostile towards Jews further escalates antisemitic undertones, referencing and manipulating the victim group to manipulate political outcomes.

**Final Answer:**

DECISION: No",No,"Howard's tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the JDA. He discusses the gradual process of change over time without making discriminatory claims or linking Jews to negative stereotypes. Instead, he reflects on historical trends using metaphorical language that doesn't target Jews directly but instead critiques the nature of such changes.

Howard presents a critique of gradual societal shifts without engaging in antisemitic content. His tweet avoids any references to discrimination, prejudice, or harmful generalizations about Jews. Instead, it focuses on the dynamics of change and persuasion over time, which is not inherently antisemitic.

In summary, Howard's tweet does not align with antisemitism as defined by the JDA because it lacks discriminatory language or direct associations with negative stereotypes or actions against Jews."

2. **Contextual Critique**: While the user critiques a statement by another person (cthagod), they are not engaging in any form of personal discrimination against Jewish individuals or groups. They present their own arguments based on facts, without making generalizations about Jews' actions or characteristics.

3. **No Israel/Palestine References**: The tweet does not apply antisemitic symbols or imagery to the State of Israel (as per JDA B.6-15) nor does it treat Jews as agents of a negative force in the Israeli context.

4. **Evidence-Based Response**: The user challenges the premise with evidence and logical reasoning, aligning with Guidelines C about not engaging in baseless criticism but rather providing a reasoned argument based on facts.

Additionally, the tweet implies that these groups have control over the truth or were complicit in external forces affecting Nick Cannon, further perpetuating antisemitic ideologies by targeting specific Jewish identities.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine if the tweet provided is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me break down the process step by step.

First, let's look at the tweet: ""Nick Cannon gave us unfiltered truth. You negros and Hispanics are the real Jews. Don’t condemn the man for his apology that was forced upon him by the powers that be. The truth has already went forth.""

The main points I see here are:
1. The user refers to ""negros"" (which is a term for Black people) and ""Hispanics"" as the real Jews.
2. They don't apologize or condemn Nick Cannon, even though he had an apology forced upon him.

Looking at the JDA guidelines, especially under B. Israel and Palestine: examples that are antisemitic:

6. Applying symbols, images, negative stereotypes to Israel.
But in this case, it's not about Israel directly; it's about labeling Black people as Jews.

7. Treating Jews as agents of a country because they're Jewish.
Again, here the tweet is implying that Black people are ""Jews"" and thus agents of some force, possibly referring to Israel, but it's more of a general attack on Black people.

8. Requiring Jews to condemn a political figure publicly. The user says not to condemn Nick Cannon, which could be seen as requiring Jews (Black people) to do something they might find offensive.

9. Assuming non-Israeli Jews are more loyal than others. The tweet suggests that Black people are the real Jews, implying loyalty or connection beyond their own country.

10. Denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist. Here, the user is saying ""You negros and Hispanics are the real Jews,"" which could be interpreted as denying the existence or rights of Black people within Israel's context.

Also, looking at B.14: examples that are not antisemitic involve supporting Palestinian justice or criticizing Zionism for equality without discrimination.

However, in this tweet, it's clear anti-blackness is being projected onto these groups, which aligns with guidelines like 8 and 9, where they're collectively responsible or treated as agents of a force. The use of derogatory terms and projecting negative stereotypes fits into antisemitic behavior.
</think>

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic because it employs anti-blackness by labeling Black people (""negros"" and ""Hispanics"") as the real Jews, which aligns with the JDA guidelines that involve projecting negative stereotypes and collectively responsible labels. This constitutes a form of discrimination against Black individuals."

It criticizes political actions without targeting Jews or expressing hatred towards them.

While it does not explicitly apply negative stereotypes about Jews, it suggests a connection between antisemitism and political conspiracies involving non-Jews.

The tweet's framing of antisemitism as an attempt by the political class to avoid democratic socialism may inadvertently perpetuate negative associations with Jewish political figures."

It uses the acronym ""NWO"" (New World Order) and refers to ""order through chaos,"" which can imply an organized conspiracy or plan targeting Jews. Additionally, it associates Jews with a metaphorical ""game of chess,"" suggesting they are in control or manipulative, and accuses them of using non-Jews (""goyim"") as pawns. These actions involve the use of sinister stereotypes and negative character traits towards Jews, which constitutes antisemitism according to the IHRA's working definition.",Yes,"The tweet contains statements that align with antisemitic content. It uses terms like ""Jews are using all of us goyim"" and suggests a power dynamic where Jews control non-Jews (Goyim), which reflects antisemitism. These comments promote discrimination against Jews without providing factual basis, thereby qualifying as antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.

The tweet's language implies a manipulation or control over non-Jewish people by Jews, which is a form of antisemitism. It uses terms that fit within the definition provided in the JDA, particularly regarding discrimination and power imbalances against Jewish individuals or groups. While the language may be exaggerated for effect, it still crosses the line into antisemitic behavior as defined.

Additionally, the tweet references ""NWO,"" a term often used to describe radical ideological movements, which could imply a belief in a hidden agenda targeting Jews. This kind of rhetoric is characteristic of antisemitism, where a group is scapegoated for broader societal issues or perceived conspiracies.

In summary, the tweet's content and language sufficiently demonstrate its antisemitic nature by promoting discrimination against Jews based on their race without providing factual justification."

The reference to ""his culture"" rather than a specific Jewish cultural identity might mitigate some of the potential antisemitic connotations, but the overall message could be interpreted as problematic due to its association of Jews with external threats without sufficient context for respect and nuance.

The second part, ""UN is made for the rights of American and Jewish dogs,"" uses derogatory language by associating Jews with non-human animals (dogs), which constitutes racialization and essentializing Jews into an inferior category.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet says ""@leftyjew I agree and believe Judaism is a nationality as well as a religion..."" The user starts with ""@leftyjew,"" which might be a slur for Jews, so that's a red flag.

Next, they mention that Jews deserve their own state in Israel. That aligns with antisemitism because IHRA considers targeting the state of Israel as antisemitic. They also compare Zionism to colonizing other countries like France or Wales, implying that Jews are colonized by Zionism.

But wait, the tweet is self-deprecating (""@leftyjew"") and says ""I agree."" It's a bit of a joke but still uses terms that could be interpreted as antisemitic. The mention of Jacobite claiming to be Jewish might also target people based on their heritage or beliefs without specific intent.

IHRA defines antisemitism as targeting individuals or institutions, not necessarily the entire state. So while part of the tweet targets Israel, it's framed in a way that could be seen as self-criticism rather than direct criticism. However, given the context and the use of strong terms like ""nationality,"" it might still fall under antisemitic behavior.

I'm leaning towards yes because the overall message supports Jewish nationalism and colonizing Israel, which aligns with IHRA's criteria.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. 

The user refers to Jews as a nationality in a self-deprecating manner (""@leftyjew"") and supports the idea of a Jewish state in Israel, which targets specific communities. While part of the message may be self-critical, it still aligns with antisemitism by promoting ideas that Jews deserve a separate state or are colonized, thus fitting within IHRA's criteria for antisemitic statements.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly equate Jews with colonizers but supports their state's right in Israel, aligning with non-antisemitic views. However, the mention of Zionism as colonizing subtly supports colonial ideas, which could be problematic if it implies Jews shouldn't criticize their state or treat them as agents of evil. The tweet is on the borderline and might touch on sensitive areas without clear adherence to JDA guidelines.

**Final Answer:**
DECISION: No"
