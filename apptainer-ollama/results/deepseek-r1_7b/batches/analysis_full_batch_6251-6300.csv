THE LAST JEWS IN YEMEN ARE ABOUT TO BE ETHNICALLY CLEANSED. THE LAST JEWS IN YEMEN ARE ABOUT TO BE ETHNICALLY CLEANSED. THE LAST JEWS IN YEMEN ARE ABOUT TO BE E,Yes,"The tweet employs the term ""ETHNICALLY CLEANSED"" to refer to the last Jews in Yemen, a phrase often used in Holocaust denial as part of antisemitic rhetoric. This aligns with IHRA's definition by targeting Jews based on ethnicity, inciting hatred and using dehumanizing language that is a tool for Holocaust denial. The repetition of ""JEWS"" further emphasizes this antisemitic stance, fitting within the IHRA's criteria of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or negative perceptions about Jewish individuals.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It focuses specifically on the elimination of Jewish people in Yemen and does not employ any stereotypical language, conspiracy theories, or systematic discrimination against all Jews. While it targets a specific group, it is not part of broader anti-Semitic stereotypes or ideologies that JDA defines as antisemitic."

The phrase ""bullshit"" implies judgment against Jews without specifying who exactly, fitting the pattern of general, hateful remarks directed at an entire group. This aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves expressing hatred towards Jews through speech and public discourse. Therefore, according to the IHRA's criteria, this tweet constitutes antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as it uses a term (""jews"") to label a specific group without context, implying that this criticism should not apply to them individually. This constitutes discrimination and violates the definition of antisemitism by targeting a particular population and imposing negative treatment based on their identity.

The tweet employs essentialization by labeling Jews in general, which is problematic as it reduces an entire group to a stereotype. The ask for a ""free pass"" implies that the criticism should not apply to them directly, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes of self-righteousness or exclusive judgment. Additionally, the term ""jews"" could be viewed as essentializing, aligning with guideline 1 which cautions against treating a group as inherently evil without cause.

Furthermore, the tweet does not provide specific examples of behavior but instead makes a general statement about Jews being labeled and treated differently, contributing to antisemitic attitudes. The use of ""bullshit"" without context may be seen as derogatory towards Jews in general, aligning with the guidelines that emphasize discriminatory treatment based on race or ethnicity.

In conclusion, the tweet exhibits characteristics of antisemitism by essentializing a group, making broad generalizations, and reinforcing stereotypes about Jews."

There are about 450,000 Israelis of Iraqi descent. https://t.co/eJSbWNafCF",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as per the IHRA definition because it uses language that targets individuals based on their ethnic origin (""Jews in Arab lands who were ethnically cleansed"") and employs dehumanizing terms like ""cleansed."" It also perpetuates a narrative that scapegoats Middle Eastern people, fitting into common anti-Semitic tropes.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly use the term ""Jewish"" beyond describing Amir's family background. It focuses on individual success rather than making broad statements about Jews in Arab lands being ethnically cleansed, which could be seen as essentializing a group without specific context or detail.

However, upon closer examination, the mention of ""one of a million Jews in Arab lands who were ethnically cleansed"" is problematic because it generalizes about a group of Jews. This statement could fall under JDA's guideline 1 by treating Jews as a homogeneous group with a shared negative trait without sufficient context or specifics. Therefore, while the tweet doesn't directly label Jews negatively, its reference to a large number of Jews being cleansed could still be considered antisemitic based on the generalization and essentialization it implies.

But considering that the tweet describes Amir's personal background and achievements specifically about him rather than as a group, perhaps the essentialization is less direct. However, according to JDA guidelines, making broad statements about Jews can be problematic if they lead to essentialism or stereotypes. Thus, while not a direct use of the term ""Jewish,"" it touches on a negative trait attributed to a group without sufficient context.

Given this nuanced analysis, I will conclude that the tweet may still be considered antisemitic due to its association of persecution with Jews in general terms."

While it is primarily a linguistic critique, it touches on themes of terminology and stereotypes that can contribute to a negative perception of Jews, particularly in contexts related to Israel's history.

This aligns with antisemitism as defined by the JDA, which includes using negative stereotypes or labels to perpetuate prejudice against Jews.

The tweet's use of ""JEWISH"" reinforces a harmful stereotype associated with antisemitism, even though it doesn't directly target individuals or institutions related to Israel. By falsely accusing Jews of a historical event and using a stereotypical label, the tweet contributes to broader antisemitic behavior as per the JDA guidelines.

Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic due to its use of negative stereotypes reinforcing harmful associations about Jews."

While it conflates historical events involving Spain's treatment of Jews with colonial actions described as violent non-intellectualism, it is not targeting any specific Jewish group or country like Israel.

Antisemitism involves targeting specific Jewish groups with negative stereotypes or prejudice, which this tweet does by singling them out and using condescending language. Therefore, it meets the IHRA definition of antisemitism.

---

DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet does not explicitly use any antisemitic language or symbols. While it mentions ""Jews"" in a context that could imply judgment based on ethnicity, there is no direct or overt discrimination against Jews.

You're coming off racist and this does not help zionism",No,"The tweet from Samuel Dinkels does not meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism because it does not involve directed hatred toward specific Jewish individuals or groups. Instead, it categorizes people based on their support for or opposition to Zionism (Israel). Antisemitism requires targeting Jews themselves with negative stereotypes or hatred, which this tweet avoids by focusing on others' beliefs rather than individual Jews.

The tweet's comment about being ""racist"" could imply a stereotype towards Jewish people in general but does not explicitly target them as a group. Additionally, the IHRA definition emphasizes expressions directed toward individuals, properties, institutions, or symbols associated with Jews, which are absent here. Therefore, while there may be some overlap in discussing anti-Zionism, it doesn't meet the specific criteria of antisemitism under the IHRA definition.

In conclusion, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic according to the IHRA's working definition because it does not involve hatred or negative expressions directed specifically at Jewish individuals or groups.",Yes,"The tweet from Samuel_Dinkels is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentialization and Generalization**: The tweet uses terms like ""anti-zionist Jews"" which essentializes anti-Zionism by linking it directly to being Jewish, a practice that aligns with guideline 2.A.1 of the JDA. This involves treating anti-Zionism as an inherent trait tied to Jewish identity without providing evidence or nuance.

2. **Racist Labeling**: By calling ""anti-zionist Jews"" racist, Samuel is making broad and negative generalizations about a population. This is problematic because it stigmatizes a group based on their political stance without justification, reinforcing harmful stereotypes.

3. **Tone and Dismissive Attitude**: The tweet's dismissive tone implies that only some anti-Zionists are problematic, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes without providing evidence or constructive criticism. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines against judgmental or dismissive rhetoric directed at specific groups.

4. **Lack of Evidence-Based Criticism**: The tweet does not provide factual basis for its claims but instead labels without argumentation. This is a form of stigmatization, as it seeks to denigrate a group by associating them with negative stereotypes rather than addressing their views constructively.

Overall, the tweet violates multiple aspects of antisemitism outlined in the JDA, including essentialization, generalization, and harmful labeling, making it antisemitic."

While it does point out potential misrepresentation, it doesn't explicitly target Jewish individuals or use outdated stereotypes about their experiences, thus avoiding IHRA's definition of antisemitism.

However, upon further reflection, if someone else were making a false comparison by trivializing the Holocaust with modern issues, then criticizing that would be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes. But since the tweet itself doesn't directly accuse anyone but makes a general critique, it might not fully align with IHRA's criteria. Therefore, the answer remains No.

Wait, I think my earlier conclusion was incorrect because the tweet is indeed criticizing a false stereotype by others (comparing modern issues to WWII genocide), thus promoting outdated narratives that could be seen as perpetuating antisemitism. Therefore, the correct answer is:

DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet addresses a potential misrepresentation of historical facts regarding the Holocaust and compares it to a simplistic or incorrect portrayal. It is critical of false comparisons rather than promoting any form of discrimination, prejudice, or trivialization against Jews as a group.

Without explicit context confirming the game's content, it is reasonable to infer that the tweet promotes a stereotype-laden approach, which aligns with JDA guidelines regarding antisemitism.

The use of #JEWSOUT suggests a deliberate attempt to associate Jews with negative connotations, akin to symbols used in anti-Semitic rhetoric.

Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by understanding the question and the provided information.

The user has asked whether the tweet in question is antisemitic based on IHRA's working definition. The IHRA defines antisemitism as a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. It can take various forms, such as speech, writing, visual expressions, or actions, and often employs negative stereotypes.

The tweet provided by the user is: 

""@BrasasEn @openeysdown @Steven495 @Talal9409 @TopRantKing @No_Israel_State @mamash_lo @Leylakhalid22 @makjob786 @kimbennylarsen @BeerBaron14 @SeguelSaul @passtheduchi @Joseetje3 @pohonyangdamai @mrpeabody @david_starof @shez19833 @EliavAbey @mlirh @Scripteladora @m_jew @TheZionist3 @ladyalmagreen @nigib1 @iluvdemocracy99 @DrawNiv @LehiRed @HebMacMan @AlbertGooner @dlsmith0817 @BoomerangTime @EnLiEretzAheret @PriestSanity @YourFriendZippy @Mabigbelio @AaIsrael2 @BoomTown85 @qtr_uk96 @AMilitantAgnost @StoliMark @fruitbatoo @RuruRola73 @slax43 @coaxialcreature @DavidSy32945540 @GlennnRoss @ilanyvv @shoozer12 @scopevale ApartheidIsrael, if there is a more racist nation on this planet of our, I don't know who it is. Black Jews, are actually treated appalling by the way. Check out David Sheen. He's done a lot of work exposing this https://t.co/s23B9r1fkw""

The task is to analyze this tweet using the IHRA definition and decide if it constitutes antisemitism.

First, I'll break down what antisemitism means according to IHRA: it involves hatred toward Jews, expressed through various forms such as speech, writing, etc. It can include targeting specific groups or institutions related to Israel, using negative stereotypes, or accusing Jews of conspiracies or responsibility for historical atrocities.

Looking at the tweet:

1. The user mentions ""@ApartheidIsrael"" and refers to ""Black Jews being treated horribly.""
2. They mention David Sheen as someone who has exposed this.
3. There's a link provided: https://t.co/s23B9r1fkw

Now, I need to evaluate each part.

The tweet starts with mentions of several people and organizations, but the key content is in the text:

- The first line refers to ""ApartheidIsrael."" Apartheid was South Africa's policy towards Black Africans. Some might confuse it with antisemitism, especially if they associate it with similar ideologies or practices.
  
- Then, the user states that Black Jews are treated 'appalling' and suggests consulting David Sheen. 

This raises a few flags:

1. **Mention of Apartheid**: The term ""ApartheidIsrael"" is problematic because it conflates South Africa's apartheid regime with Israel. While some might mistakenly equate the two, it could be seen as promoting stereotypes about Israel due to historical contexts that are not directly related.
   
2. **Denying Israel's existence or role**: By mentioning ApartheidIsrael without context and referring to Black Jews in a negative light, this could imply that Israel is responsible for the suffering of Black Jews, which might align with antisemitic stereotypes.

3. **Accusation and stigmatization**: The tweet attacks Black Jews as if they are being treated poorly by Israel, which can be seen as a stereotype. It's using a historical event (apartheid) to make broad accusations about Jews today.

4. **Use of David Sheen**: Referring to someone who has exposed such issues might support the idea that these injustices towards Black Jews are known and publicized, furthering antisemitic narratives.

Now, considering the IHRA definition: antisemitism includes targeting specific groups (Jews or Black Jews here), using negative stereotypes, and making broad accusations without a foundation in evidence. The tweet also seems to present these issues as part of a chain that includes Israel, potentially implying that Israeli policies are linked to these injustices.

I should check if there's any basis for these claims. For instance, is Apartheid directly related to Black Jews being treated poorly by Israel? In reality, Apartheid was South Africa's policy against all African groups, not specifically Black Jews. However, some might argue that it involved policies of oppression towards Black Africans, which could be used to imply something similar for Jews in Israel.

Given this context, the tweet seems to stretch historical contexts (apartheid) to make broad statements about Jewish treatment, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes and stigmatization.
</think>

DECISION: No

The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. While it contains mentions that could be misconstrued as involving negative stereotypes or accusations against specific groups (Black Jews), there is no direct evidence of hatred directed toward Jews, nor does it use the IHRA's criteria such as targeting specific groups, employing negative stereotypes about Jews, or making broad accusations without foundation in evidence related to historical events like apartheid.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs a harmful stereotype by associating Black Jews with the treatment of Black people during Apartheid South Africa. This directly links Jews to a historical period of racial segregation and discrimination, which constitutes antisemitism according to the JDA guidelines. The tweet generalizes without evidence, promoting hostility and prejudice against Jewish individuals based on their ethnicity alone, making it antisemitic.

---

The tweet is **antisemitic** because it equates Black Jews with a historical event targeting Black people in South Africa (Apartheid), thereby reinforcing racial stereotypes and discrimination against Jewish individuals."

However, considering that the tweet's primary focus is on generalizing about white Jews and not specifically targeting Jewish people or institutions in a way that directly adheres to the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, it may not fully meet the criteria. The lack of explicit hatred toward individuals might reduce its impact as antisemitic compared to situations where actions directly target Jews.

Okay, so I need to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic based on the IHRA definition. The tweet says ""@britishbullybee @NathanHale007 If Biden wins this will increase. It�s time to fight or leave. Don�t be led to the slaughter like the Jews in Germany. Go all in or get out."" 

First, I'll break down what antisemitism means according to IHRA: it's any perception of Jews as hatred directed towards them, their community, or related properties and institutions.

Looking at the tweet, there's a mention of ""Jews"" specifically with the instruction not to be led to the slaughter like in Germany. The phrase ""like the Jews in Germany"" is a reference to historical persecution, which ties into Holocaust denial because IHRA considers Holocaust denial as antisemitic. 

So, the tweet uses a comparison to the Nazis' actions against Jews during WWII and refers to them as being treated unjustly or wronged. This aligns with points about attacking a perceived collective (Jews) and using historical context to justify discrimination.

Also, the tweet encourages taking action (""fight or leave"" and ""Go all in or get out"") which could imply support for oppression of a group, further supporting antisemitic views.
</think>

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it references historical persecution against Jews (like the Nazis' actions) and uses that context to justify discrimination.",Yes,"The tweet employs an analogy comparing Jews in Germany to those leading to ""the slaughter,"" projecting historical blame onto Jews. This aligns with JDA Guidelines 2 and 6, as it associates a Jewish group with harm, fitting into classical antisemitic stereotypes."

The tweet uses culturally restrictive terms (e.g., ""original Hebrews"") and dismisses melanin as part of their identity, which could be seen as denying a meaningful continuity with biblical Jewish heritage.

3. **Anti-Semitic Language and Stereotyping**: The term ""useful idiot"" referencing political marching draws parallels to Stalin's terminology, stigmatizing Jewish individuals. This is a direct use of anti-Semitic tropes without proper context or truthfulness.

The use of such broad generalizations without context supports the categorization of this tweet as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet contains elements that align with antisemitic ideas as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration. It references Solomon's Temple and implies that Jews are invaders and occupiers, which ties into antisemitic narratives of Jews as hostile or evil. Additionally, it uses historical bloodshed as justification for its claims, which is another form of stereotyping and generalization about Jews. These actions violate guidelines 6, 8, and others related to the application of antisemitic symbols and stereotypes towards Israel/Palestine."

Put it in the oven Jews = roast chicken,Yes,"The tweet employs stereotyping by equating Jews with roast chickens and suggesting that Hitler subjected them to worse treatment than others. This is a form of simplification that dehumanizes Jews, aligning with antisemitism as defined by IHRA. It uses negative and pejorative language to label Jews collectively, which constitutes harmful antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet employs a metaphor that stereotypically portrays Jews as being subjected to harsh treatment, akin to the Nazis' actions against them. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination and the use of metaphors or stereotypes to generalize about Jewish people. Specifically, by comparing Jews to being put in an oven (an image often associated with persecution), the tweet reinforces historical antisemitic views without addressing or challenging Israel/Palestine issues directly but does so in a manner consistent with antisemitism as defined."

He started off by singling out the Jews, and then mentioning the other communities. https://t.co/hnLnHUEw4i",No,"The tweet begins by singling out Jews for critique, which aligns with antisemitism as defined by IHRA. Antisemitism involves targeting individuals based on their Jewish identity, and while the tweet may also criticize other minorities, the specific mention of Jews without a legitimate reason or context outside of a broader criticism could constitute antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or stereotype Jews with specific negative traits or provide evidence of antisemitic behavior beyond categorizing them in relation to ""other communities."" Without concrete instances of discrimination, prejudice, or hostile treatment towards Jews, it is not classified as antisemitic under the JDA."

Furthermore, the mention of ""BilldeBlasio"" is ambiguous and might refer to a person unrelated to antisemitism, such as Bill de Blasio, who has been recognized for his progressive policies. Without evidence that the tweet expresses overtly antisemitic sentiments towards specific individuals or groups without broader context, it does not conclusively meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet uses a metaphor (""Jews being caged"") that could be interpreted as projecting negative stereotypes onto Jews. This aligns with guideline 6 of B in the JDA, where symbols and metaphors associated with evil are used to target Jews. While the tweet does not explicitly state anti-Semitic ideologies, it uses language that could imply a negative stereotype about Jews, potentially equating their existence or actions with negativity, thereby contributing to antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This targeted harassment aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes directing hatred and harm toward Jewish people. By promoting such a petition and implying that Jews should be harassed, the tweet exhibits antisemitic behavior through its content and purpose.",No,"The tweet in question does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews based on their Jewishness. While the tweet uses negative stereotypes about Jews (""@LuckyRusalka"") and critiques what it perceives as harmful labeling, its primary purpose is satirical or mocking rather than consistently applying antisemitic ideologies to specific individuals or groups. The content does not engage in systematic discrimination against individual Jews but rather mocks a societal tendency to label people based on their profession, which can perpetuate stereotypes. Therefore, the tweet falls short of meeting the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by the JDA."

Khamenei is a #CancerousTumor on Society! Iran's supreme leader calls for Israel's destruction in Twitter screed on anti-Israel holiday https://t.co/Q8k2RwuFcU #FoxNews,Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitic content by drawing parallels between contemporary threats against Jews and those of the Nazis, which normalizes extreme historical contexts. It also directly attacks Iran's supreme leader while promoting anti-Semitic sentiments towards an anti-Israel holiday, reinforcing outdated stereotypes. These actions align with IHRA criteria as they involve expressions of hatred and contribute to societal harm directed toward Jews or Jewish-related entities.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism by referencing historical anti-Semitic stereotypes. It compares Iran's supreme leader, Khomeini, to the Nazis, implying that his threats are like those targeting Jews. Additionally, it mentions Hitler's hatred of Jews and refers to an ""anti-Israel holiday,"" which could perpetuate anti-Semitic biases. These elements align with JDA guidelines 2 and 15, making the tweet antisemitic."

Why again did you oppose the House resolution against antisemitism?",No,"The tweet does not directly reference or accuse Jews of any actions, but by associating the Holocaust with antisemitism without providing a specific Jewish group as the cause, it touches on a sensitive topic. However, since it doesn't explicitly oppose or stereotype Jews regarding their association with the Holocaust, it might not fully meet the criteria for being antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA because it employs language that implies ""literal genocide,"" which could be interpreted as a conspiracy theory attributing harm to Jews, in line with A.2. Additionally, opposing a House resolution against antisemitism opposes efforts to combat such discrimination, touching on C.14 and other guidelines regarding political opposition without justification.

The tweet's use of terms like ""genocide"" and its dismissal of a resolution aimed at combating antisemitism aligns with the JDA's definition by promoting harmful stereotypes or stigmatizing Jews, thus qualifying it as antisemitic."

It is a self-criticism where the speaker states that targeting Jews leads to their own targeting, which is a personal sentiment without any overt hatred or stereotyping towards Jews.

The tweet is about an individual's critique of behavior directed at Jews, framed as a statement about how such behavior would affect them personally. There is no mention of antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or group-level discrimination. It does not target the Jewish community as a whole but reflects on personal reactions to such actions.",Yes,"The tweet from MzC Smith reads, ""If you target Jews you target me."" This statement suggests that targeting someone based on their identity as a Jew (Jewish heritage) without specific intent towards an individual is implied. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes discrimination or essentializing based on identity. The tweet could be seen as implying that being Jewish is a target in itself, which aligns with guidelines 1 and 2 of the JDA. Essentializing or treating someone based on their heritage without considering individual circumstances constitutes a form of antisemitism. Therefore, this tweet is classified as antisemitic under the JDA's definition.
