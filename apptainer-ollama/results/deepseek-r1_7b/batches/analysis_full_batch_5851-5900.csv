**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Tweet:** The tweet commemorates Holocaust Remembrance Day by honoring the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis, referencing them as victims alongside ""other groups of perimeter victims.""

2. **Application of JDA Guidelines:**
   - **Guideline 4 and 10:** These guidelines discuss singling out Jews for their suffering or denying their rights. The tweet implies that Jews are being focused on while other groups are not, potentially implying discrimination.

3. **Conclusion:** There's no overt antisemitic elements such as promoting negative stereotypes, making sweeping generalizations about Jews, or referring to their denial of rights. Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA definition."

That ""solidarity"" would be a resigning matter in a normal and decent party.  Labour is no such party.",Unclear,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the tweet says that a Labour MP expressed solidarity with ""political prisoners"" who are actually terrorist murderers of Jews. The MP now wants to defeat antisemitism, stating that such solidarity would be a resignation in a normal and decent party, and Labour is no such party.

Looking at the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews, whether expressed as speech, actions, etc., targeting individuals or institutions, not necessarily the state of Israel. The tweet's context seems to target specific individuals who are labeled as terrorists murderers of Jews, implying they're anti-Semitic by associating them with terrorism.

The MP is using the term ""political prisoners"" without any indication that they themselves are Jewish. Instead, she's attacking someone else, claiming they're terrorists murderers targeting Jews. This could be a stereotypical label towards Jews, projecting negative characteristics onto a group (Jews) based on their association with another negative trait (terrorism).

Additionally, the tweet implies that such solidarity is unacceptable in Labour, which might be seen as collectively blaming Jews for the actions of non-Jews, fitting the IHRA definition where responsibility or blame is unfairly assigned to an entire group.

Therefore, the tweet likely contains elements of antisemitism by using stigmatization and projecting negative stereotypes towards Jews.
</think>

DECISION: No

The tweet does not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA's definition. 

The tweet refers to individuals as ""political prisoners"" who are ""terrorist murderers of Jews."" This phrasing targets a group (Jews) through an association with terrorism, using stigmatization that is indirect and unrelated to explicit prejudice against Jews themselves. The tweet does not express hatred or discrimination towards specific Jewish individuals or groups but rather critiques someone else's characterization based on their association with terrorism.

Additionally, the tweet refers to Labour MP as wanting to ""defeat antisemitism,"" which implies solidarity with those who are termed terrorists murderers of Jews. However, this is framed as a critique of an external behavior (solidarity) rather than direct discrimination or hatred toward Jews. The phrasing does not target specific Jewish individuals or groups but instead uses a broad critique based on their association with terrorism.

Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA because it does not involve explicit hatred, discriminatory behavior, or stigmatization directed towards Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet in question makes an antisemitic accusation by referring to ""political prisoners"" who are accused of being ""terrorist murderers of Jews."" This directly discriminates against Jews and aligns with the JDA's definition, which includes any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews.

Therefore, it violates the guidelines set forth by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA)."

Not their vile antisemites, pro BDS stance, cozying up with Islamonazis, and hate for Israel.  American Jews still cling to the fantasy of conservative racism and bury their heads in the sand.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It uses derogatory language directed at American Jews, such as ""vile antisemites"" and terms implying they are responsible for societal issues like pro-BDS stance. The tweet also employs broad generalizations, blaming Jewish people for their perceived wrongs without specific justification, aligning with antisemitic practices of scapegoating and reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish communities in the U.S.

The tweet specifically targets American Jews by name, uses language that dehumanizes them, and frames their community as collectively problematic. This matches the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes directing hatred toward a specific group (American Jews) through various means of expression, often using stereotypes or negative character traits to justify such behavior.

Additionally, the tweet's context aligns with antisemitic tropes where Jewish communities are scapegoated for political issues within the U.S., reflecting how antisemitism operates by associating targeted groups with negative outcomes. Thus, all these elements confirm that the tweet is antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.",No,"The tweet uses coded language and stereotyping to associate Democrats with negative attributes associated with antisemitism, such as being ""vile antisemites"" and supporting BDS. It equates Democratic actions towards Liberal American Jews with antisemitic behavior, using conservative racism rhetoric to demean Jewish individuals. This aligns with JDA's guidelines on how antisemitism can be manifested in speech or public sentiment through coded language targeting specific groups based on prejudice rather than factual accuracy.

However, upon closer examination, the tweet does not explicitly equate Democrats with antisemitism but rather labels them as having ""vile antisemitic"" tendencies. While it uses coded language to associate Democrats with negative stereotypes about Jews, this approach still falls under the broader definition of antisemitism as discriminatory or prejudiced behavior against Jews."

Damn the mayor to hell!,No,"The tweet does not directly target or stereotypedly describe Jews in a way that fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism. While it mentions ""Jews"" and suggests they should take action against a political figure, there is no overt hatred or dehumanizing language directed specifically at Jewish individuals. Instead, it appears to be a critique of the mayor's actions without assigning special responsibility or blame to Jews as a group. The tweet does not use language that generalizes behavior towards Jewish people beyond a political context, thus avoiding the key elements of antisemitism outlined by IHRA.

However, upon closer examination, I realize that my initial analysis might have overlooked some nuances. Antisemitism can involve associating with groups based on religion or ethnicity for political reasons, which this tweet does to an extent. The suggestion that Jews should take action against the mayor could be interpreted as implying a stereotype where Jews are unfairly targeted or blamed for societal issues. This indirect association might be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes about Jewish individuals in a broader context.

Given this reconsideration, it's possible that the tweet could be interpreted within the framework of antisemitism if it is perceived to associate Jews with negative political actions without evidence. Therefore, considering potential interpretations that align with stereotyping based on ethnicity for political motives, the tweet might be viewed as antisemitic.

In Britain he wasn't popular, and was voted out by overwhelming majority in 1945. He was widely seen as a Jewish pawn over there. https://t.co/xXJnhwHXlr",Yes,"The tweet employs stereotyping by associating Winston Churchill's perceived nonpopularity in Britain with his Jewish heritage, suggesting that his actions were motivated by his Jewish identity. This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it involves perpetuating negative stereotypes and generalizations about Jews influencing historical figures or their legacy.",No,"- **Point 1:** The assertion that Churchill's greatness is a ""Jewish pawn"" meme is based on stereotypes and not historical facts. Such claims can be seen as essentializing Jews, which is a form of antisemitism.
- **Point 2:** Claiming Churchill was voted out in Britain due to being a ""Jewish pawn"" perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jewish influence over British leadership during the war. This is a stereotyping element that aligns with antisemitism.
- **Point 3:** Associating Churchill's perceived role as a ""Jewish pawn"" reinforces negative stereotypes and manipulative behavior attributed to Jews, which is a form of antisemitic behavior.

However, upon closer examination:
The tweet's framing of Churchill and his association with Jewish stereotypes is problematic. It essentializes Churchill through the lens of Jewish influence without providing factual basis or nuance. This aligns with JDA guidelines that prohibit stereotyping and essentializing groups based on false narratives. Therefore, while the approach is flawed from a historical standpoint, it does not conform to antisemitism as defined by the JDA because it does not fit within its outlined criteria for identifying such behavior.

The tweet's use of stereotypes about Churchill's relationship with Jewishness may reflect broader biases but does not directly apply the JDA's definition without some nuance. Thus, while it contains harmful stereotypes, it doesn't fully align with the antisemitism defined by the JDA guidelines."

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements**: The tweet associates IlhanMN with David Duke, who is known for anti-Semitic statements.
2. **Apply Definition**: According to IHRA, any perception or behavior targeting Jewish individuals or groups with hatred fits the definition.
3. **Contextual Analysis**: The mention of an anti-Semite endorsement and critical remarks towards U.S.-Israel relations imply a hostile stance toward Jews.
4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the tweet exhibits behaviors that meet the antisemitic criteria outlined by IHRA.

DECISION: Yes",Yes,"The tweet attacks Ilhan Muhammad by associating her with David Duke, a known anti-Semite, thereby using anti-Semitic stereotypes.

**Analysis ofIHRA's Definition of Antisemitism**

The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) defines antisemitism as a perceived hatred toward Jews, manifesting in speech, writing, visual forms, or action against individuals or communities. This includes targeting Jewish institutions and religious facilities.

**Case Study: Maurice Samuel's Tweet**

- **Content Analysis**: The tweet uses strong language directed at Jews, suggesting they are the perpetual problem-solvers responsible for societal issues. It employs confrontational and discriminatory rhetoric.
  
- **Application of IHRA's Criteria**:
  - **Expression of Hatred**: Directly expresses hatred toward Jews as a people.
  - **Collective Perceptions**: Paints Jews as collectively responsible, aligning with antisemitism that involves negative perceptions about Jews.

Given these points, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",No,"Maurice Samuel's tweet does not explicitly target Jews beyond an initial reference, nor does it use coded language typical of antisemitism. The statement employs strong, generalizing claims that could perpetuate negative stereotypes about gentile people, potentially aligning with the spirit of antisemitism by reinforcing harmful narratives.

According to the IHRA's definition, antisemitism requires more than just general criticism; it involves specific targeting and historical context. The tweet risks reducing a complex issue into broad statements that may not account for nuanced cases where criticism is constructive or justified without perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Therefore, while it touches on an element of antisemitism, it does so in a way that is too generalized to fully comply with the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not directly engage in any of the prohibited acts listed under the JDA guidelines related to antisemitism. It is simply questioning whether negative remarks about Jews are considered antisemitic, without promoting or engaging in any form of antisemitic speech itself. Therefore, according to the JDA, this tweet is not antisemitic.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition of Antisemitism:** According to the JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence specifically directed at Jews.
2. **Nature of the Tweet:** The tweet raises a general question about negative remarks on Jews without actively promoting any antisemitic views or actions.
3. **Relevance to Guidelines:**
   - It does not advocate for racial hatred (guideline 1).
   - It doesn't align with any examples under B. that are explicitly antisemitic (e.g., supporting Israel's policies as per guideline 12).
   - It isn't promoting BDS or political statements that could be considered biased against Jews.
4. **Conclusion:** The tweet is not an act of antisemitism but a statement on the topic, without engaging in prohibited practices itself.

Thus, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic under the JDA's definition."

This reflects IHRA's definition as it involves negative characterization of Jews contributing to a broader judgment against their beliefs or actions.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria of antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration. Here's why:

1. **No Essentialization**: The tweet does not generalize about all Jews but refers specifically to an individual, so it doesn't essentialize a group.

2. **No Linking to Evil**: The tweet does not explicitly link Jews to evil (like the Holocaust), which is required for antisemitism under JDA guideline 2.

3. **No Denial of Holocaust**: The tweet does not explicitly deny the Holocaust, which is crucial for antisemitic content as per guidelines 10 and 15.

4. **No Opposition to Zionism**: The tweet doesn't criticize Zionism or support Palestinian rights as per JDA's guidelines on this matter (guideline 12).

In conclusion, while the tweet touches on sensitive topics, it does not meet the specific criteria outlined in the JDA for antisemitism."

While it references historical events involving groups associated with antisemitic ideologies, it does not express hatred toward Jews in a way that aligns with the IHRA's operational guidelines. The tweet is more of a historical critique without incitement to hatred or discrimination against Jews.

The tweet refers to the Final Solution and Holocaust, which are well-documented atrocities against Jews. However, the manner in which it frames this reference does not inherently perpetuate antisemitism as defined by IHRA. Instead, it appears to be an expression of historical critique without associating the accusers with hatred or conspiracy theories about Jews.

Therefore, while the tweet touches on sensitive topics related to antisemitism, it does not directly or indirectly express hatred toward Jews or use language that aligns with the IHRA's operational definition.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It refers to historical facts about the Holocaust and WWII, attributing the Holocaust to the Nazis without any negative connotation towards Jews. The statement is neutral, making factual claims without using any discriminatory language or stereotypes associated with antisemitism. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitic content as defined by the JDA."
1255482522294784004,DeploraH,2020-04-29 13:02:13+00:00,0,Jews,RT @seanmdav: New York City�s mayor just ordered police to start rounding up Jews. https://t.co/87IeFFk2yc,Yes,"The tweet from Sean McDowell directs New York City's police to start rounding up Jews. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred directed specifically at Jews or their properties. While the tweet doesn't explicitly call out Jewish individuals as targets without context, promoting actions against them could be interpreted as antisemitic discrimination. The tweet singles out Jews for repression, aligning with the IHRA's criteria of targeting a specific group for exclusionary treatment.",No,"The tweet from Sean MDav about New York City's mayor ordering police to round up Jews does not align with antisemitic criteria under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **No Essentialization**: The tweet describes a law enforcement action without any personal attacks or negative stereotypes directed specifically at Jews.
2. **No Conspiracy Theory Reference**: It does not imply any hidden agenda or ""conspiracy theory"" linking Jews to controlling institutions, which is a cornerstone of antisemitism in the JDA guidelines.
3. **No Fact-Based Claim**: The tweet presents factual information about law enforcement action without introducing any discriminatory elements.

Thus, the tweet is neutral and does not fit into the categories outlined by the JDA as antisemitic. It simply reports an event without incitement to discrimination or prejudice against Jews."
