However, given that the tweet compares the cancellation to a significant historical event involving Jews, it could be seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes without context, which aligns with antisemitic practices by using symbols and negative imagery to dismiss criticism inappropriately.

The analysis concludes that while the tweet may use symbolic language, it does not explicitly equate Jewish people with the Holocaust or solely focus on negative connotations of cancellation. Instead, it seems to dismiss the speaker's argument without providing a constructive response, which could be seen as antisemitic due to its association of cancelation with a universally recognized historical event linked to Jews."

2. **Essentialization**: By suggesting that Orthodox Jews are inherently at risk due to their Jewish identity, the tweet employs essentialist language typical of antisemitism. It reduces a community to its cultural or religious characteristics without acknowledging diverse factors contributing to issues.

3. **Denying Accountability**: The criticism seems directed at avoiding responsibility within the same community, which can be seen as hostile and discriminatory against a specific group (Orthodox Jews) within it.

4. **Pattern of Behavior**: Such behavior aligns with antisemitic tropes that use Jewish identities to manipulate or distance oneself from addressing issues, perpetuating harmful stereotypes about Jews.

The use of ""Jews"" here could imply that non-Jews are not part of the Shabbat community unless they identify as Jews, which is exclusionary.

A reminder that if democracy becomes vulnerable, genocidal forces in the wings are ready to rise. Yes, even in America. #CapitolRiots https://t.co/TYdhkXvbY3",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: ""Yesterday some Proud Boys wore shirts with 6MWE insignia. It means 6 million (Jews) wasn't enough. A reminder that if democracy becomes vulnerable, genocidal forces in the wings are ready to rise. Yes, even in America. #CapitolRiots""

First, I should break down what each part is saying. The user mentions the Proud Boys wearing shirts with ""6MWE"" insignia and then refers to 6 million Jews not being enough. They also talk about democratic vulnerabilities leading to genocidal forces, using the term ""genocide"" which is a strong word.

Now, looking at the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews, either expressed through rhetoric or physical actions against Jewish individuals or institutions. It can include conspiracy theories, blaming Jews for societal issues, and using negative stereotypes.

The tweet starts by talking about Proud Boys, who are counterfareters known for promoting white supremacy and anti-Semitic ideologies. Wearing ""6MWE"" shirts is a reference to the Holocaust victims, as 6M refers to the six million Jews. The mention of 6 million Jews suggests a comparison that could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes.

Then, they link this to the idea that if democracy is vulnerable, genocidal forces are ready to rise. The use of ""genocide"" is significant because it's a strong term often associated with systematic persecution, which can incite hatred or fear towards Jews, especially given its historical context during WWII.

The tweet also connects this to the Capitol Riots, implying that such events could lead to actions against Jewish people. This kind of rhetoric might be used to manipulate public sentiment, associating Jewish people with negative outcomes like riots.

I should check if there's any reference to Israel or anti-Semitic symbols beyond what's in ""6MWE."" It doesn't seem so; the focus is on genocidal forces and the comparison to a historical event. However, the use of ""Jews"" specifically could be problematic because it's a stereotype that can lead to antisemitism.

The IHRA definition mentions that criticism similar to that against any other country isn't antisemitic, but here they're singling out 6 million Jews, which might be seen as implying a conspiracy or exclusionary attitude towards them. Also, the comparison to Capitol Riots adds a modern context where some groups are pushing for violence against what they perceive as enemies, even in democratic settings.

So, putting it all together: The tweet uses the term ""genocide"" to link Jewish people with violent acts like riots, which aligns with antisemitic propaganda. It also directly references 6 million Jews, a number historically tied to Holocaust victims, reinforcing negative stereotypes and conspiracy thinking.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it employs several elements of antisemitic propaganda:

1. **Use of the Term ""Genocide"":** The tweet uses the term ""genocide,"" which can incite hatred towards Jews, especially considering its historical context during WWII.

2. **Reinforcement of Negative Stereotypes:** By referencing ""6MWE"" (6 million Jews), it ties Jewish people to negative connotations associated with historical atrocities and anti-Semitic ideologies.

3. **Propaganda and Manipulation:** The tweet manipulates public perception by associating Jewish people with violent actions, such as riots, potentially inflaming fear and hatred.

These elements align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, involving hate speech, conspiracy theories, and stereotyping.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly target Jews but uses a symbol, ""6MWE,"" which is often associated with far-right groups that have been linked to anti-Semitic ideologies. While the mention of ""Jews"" could be interpreted as essentializing a group or associating it with genocidal forces, this context does not directly apply antisemitic language or symbols without broader implications. Therefore, while the tweet contains elements that might touch on far-right sentiments, it does not specifically or clearly adhere to the JDA's definition of antisemitism involving discrimination against Jews."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by understanding what antisemitism means here based on their working definition.

Antisemitism, as per IHRA, includes a perception of Jews with hatred, which can be expressed in various ways like speech, writing, visual forms, and actions. It involves targeting individuals or institutions related to Jewishness, using stereotypes or negative traits. They also mention examples like criticizing Israel as a Jewish collective or using conspiracy theories against Jews.

Now looking at the tweet: ""I keep seeing this narrative here about how the Jews were passive and meek during the Holocaust, didn’t protest, and it makes me furious. It is wrong, it is dangerous, and it is harmful af."" 

The user is criticizing the idea that Jews were passive or silent during the Holocaust. They're saying this narrative is wrong, dangerous, and harmful. They're expressing strong negative feelings towards what they perceive as a lack of protest from Jews.

I need to check if this tweet meets any of the IHRA criteria. The tweet includes criticism directed at a historical event involving Jews (the Holocaust), and it's using that to expresshatred or judgment. It also refers to Jews in a negative way, suggesting they were passive, which could be considered a stereotype or negative trait.

The IHRA definition mentions that antisemitism can involve making mendacious or dehumanizing allegations about Jews as a people. In this case, the tweet is attacking a historical narrative by calling it wrong and harmful, which could fit under that category. Additionally, the tweet is using words like ""passive"" to describe Jews during the Holocaust, which could be seen as applying negative character traits stereotypically.

So putting it all together, yes, this tweet seems to be antisemitic because it attacks a perception of Jews (as passive or meek) in a way that matches IHRA's definition. It uses negative language and expresses judgment towards a historical characterization of Jews.

In the context of antisemitism, such statements can be problematic if they are part of a broader narrative that implies persecution or negative stereotypes about Jews.

**DECISION: Yes**

The tweet is considered antisemitic based on the IHRA definition because it uses harmful stereotypes and associations that incite discrimination and persecution against Jewish individuals or communities, specifically through comparisons involving ""nazi posts"" potentially linked to Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism based on the JDA definition.

Hate that was fringe is now mainstream. Thanks GOP.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition as it contains several elements that align with antisemitic behavior.

1. **Hatred toward Jews**: The tweet associates powerful Jews with white supremacy, which is a derogatory stereotype aimed at targeting Jewish people.

2. **Stereotyping and Negative Character Traits**: By projecting this onto other groups (Muslims, immigrants, Black people) and using terms like ""white supremacist conspiracy,"" it employs negative character traits towards Jews.

3. **Normalizing Antisemitic Views**: The tweet suggests that hate against Jews has become mainstream by mentioning that previously fringe views are now accepted, contributing to the normalization of antisemitism.

4. **Use of Antisemitic Tropes**: The language used aligns with common antisemitic tropes, such as projecting a negative narrative onto a specific group and using it to generalize behavior towards others.

These actions meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA, as they involve targeted perceptions and expressions directed specifically at Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet employs several key elements of antisemitism as defined by the JDA:

1. **Essentialist generalizations**: The tweet treats Jews as inherently evil or linked to negative stereotypes, such as the ""white supremacist conspiracy"" and the idea that powerful Jews control global institutions. This aligns with guideline 1 of the JDA.

2. **Projection of negative stereotypes**: By associating powerful Jews with white supremacy, hate groups, and other negative stereotypes (e.g., lasers, Black people), the tweet continues a long-standing antisemitic narrative. This is consistent with guidelines 2 and 5.

3. **Coded speech**: The reference to ""hate that was fringe is now mainstream"" implies acceptance of previously taboo ideas about Jews, reinforcing antisemitic associations without directly stating them, which fits guideline 4.

4. **Association with other negative groups**: Although the tweet does not explicitly mention Black people or hate groups beyond the initial context of white supremacy, it continues a pattern of associating Jews with negativity through coded language.

In summary, the tweet uses essentialist language, projects a conspiracy narrative aligned with antisemitic stereotypes, employs coded speech, and associates Jews with other negative groups, all of which meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Additionally, the mention of concentration camps can be seen as referencing trauma that is tied to anti-Semitic history, thus contributing to antisemitism by equating a form of rule (Christian) with the systematic oppression of Jews."

Comparing it to losing Twitter followers is a disgusting desecration of our ancestors' pain.\n\nI'll show you where you can shove some broken glass, Steve https://t.co/RfEqGRPpCj",Unclear,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the tweet in question is about Kristallnacht and its relation to the Holocaust. The user compares Kristallnacht to losing Twitter followers as a way to dismiss or minimize the pain caused by the Holocaust. They also link this to suggesting where they can ""shove some broken glass,"" which seems like a derogatory comment.

Looking at the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred toward Jews and includes both verbal and physical manifestations directed specifically at Jewish individuals or groups. It also mentions that such acts are often used as an excuse for broader issues affecting humanity.

The tweet's main points seem to be:

1. Mistaking Kristallnacht (a pogrom) for being government-led against Jews, which is a historical fact—it was Nazi Germany's action, so that part might be stretching the definition since it's not specifically targeting Jews but rather linking it to antisemitism.

2. Comparing Kristallnacht to losing Twitter followers as a way to trivialize the Holocaust. This seems more like a modern-day ploy to dismiss or minimize historical atrocities by equating them with something irrelevant (Twitter followers) and suggesting that this is ""where you can shove some broken glass,"" implying frustration at being mocked.

3. Using the term ""Jews"" in a negative context, possibly implying that their suffering should not be taken seriously because it's trivialized. This could be a stereotypical stereotype where Jews are equated with negative outcomes, which fits into the IHRA's description of using sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.

I need to check if these elements meet the criteria set by IHRA. The tweet uses historical facts but frames them in a way that associates antisemitic actions (like Kristallnacht) with modern issues. It also employs a stereotype by equating Jews' suffering to something trivial, which could be seen as part of antisemitic propaganda.

Moreover, the comparison to losing Twitter followers is meant to downplay or dismiss the Holocaust's impact, suggesting that such suffering isn't taken seriously because it's not relevant in today's context. This manipulation aligns with how IHRA defines antisemitism—using negative stereotypes and misleading others about the significance of events affecting Jewish communities.

Additionally, the tweet could be seen as implying that other groups or actions (shoving broken glass) are more important than the suffering of Jews, which reinforces antisemitic views by associating their suffering with being irrelevant or lesser in importance compared to other issues.

So putting it all together, while some parts might not directly target Jewish individuals but use historical events to make broader points, the overall message and the way it's framed leans toward antisemitism as defined by IHRA.
</think>

DECISION: No

The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. 

While the tweet touches on historical events like Kristallnacht and makes a modern-day analogy to the Holocaust, it is not clear-cut. The primary issue would be if the tweet explicitly targeted Jewish individuals or groups with hatred, suggesting antisemitic stereotypes, or used language that equates Jews' suffering with trivial or irrelevant matters. 

In this case, the tweet seems more like a critique of modern social media's role in spreading negativity rather than overtly promoting or attacking Jewish communities. The analogy drawn between Kristallnacht and losing Twitter followers might be intended to dismiss historical atrocities rather than accuse specific groups of antisemitism.

Therefore, it doesn't sufficiently align with the IHRA's definition as outlined.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as per the JDA. It uses Kristallnacht to dismissively compare Jewish suffering, reducing it to a trivial analogy (losing Twitter followers) rather than addressing the gravity of historical events like the Shoah. While it may contain references that could be seen as dismissive or essentializing in certain contexts, they do not directly equate Jews with negative traits or actions without providing context that would support antisemitic stereotypes."

While it raises a critical point about the justification of mocking individuals based on their faith, it does not explicitly or implicitly target Jews as a group with inherent characteristics tied to evil or discrimination. The JDA defines antisemitism as racism or discrimination against Jews, including via essentialization or prejudice. This tweet instead critiques the logic behind mockery rather than engaging in discriminatory acts or beliefs about Jews' nature. It does not reference any specific JDA guidelines that would classify it as antisemitic, such as those related to linking Jews to evil forces (guideline 2) or targeting them based on ethnicity (guideline 1).

Alright, I need to determine if the provided tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me start by reading the tweet and understanding its content.

The tweet is directed at Masala Fry, Immyh, GMB, and Baddiel. The user is asking why a British Jew is discussing antisemitism in relation to Israel. They then advise these individuals to focus on Israel and dismiss any criticism targeting Jews without a connection to Israel as racist.

First, I'll look at the JDA definition provided. Antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. The guidelines emphasize that it's racetrack related to inherent traits like race or ethnicity. They also mention that antisemitism can manifest in speech, symbols, and deeds.

Now, looking at the tweet structure:

1. **Context of the Tweet**: The user is addressing individuals known for their Jewish heritage, suggesting they should focus on Israel instead of discussing antisemitism. They're advising others to avoid targeting Jews unrelated to Israel with criticism about Israel.

2. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Stereotyping**: By generalizing that any criticism directed at a person's Jewish identity (even if the person isn't from Israel) is racist, it risks stigmatizing all Jews without a connection to Israel.
   - **Targeting Without Connection**: The tweet seems to suggest that criticizing someone based on their Jewish heritage (even if unrelated to Israel) is problematic. This could imply that any mention of antisemitism in relation to someone's Jewish identity is wrong.

3. **JDA Guidelines**:
   - According to point 5, denying the Holocaust by minimizing it is antisemitic.
   - However, this tweet isn't about denying historical events but rather about targeting people based on their Jewish identity without a connection to Israel.

4. **Analysis**:
   The tweet seems to spread辐射 (radical) anti-Jewish stereotypes by suggesting that any mention of antisemitism against a person is racist if the person has a Jewish background, regardless of their connection to Israel. This could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes and treating people based on their heritage rather than their actions or context.

5. **Potential for Racism**:
   By advising others not to discuss antisemitism in relation to someone's Jewish identity unless they're connected to Israel, it might imply that all Jews should only be discussed if tied to Israel. This can lead to stigmatizing people without a connection to Israel who are actually innocent.

6. **Conclusion**:
   The tweet seems to spread negative stereotypes about Jews by generalizing from anyone discussing antisemitism in relation to their Jewish identity (even without an Israeli connection) as problematic, which aligns with the JDA's guidelines on essentializing and treating people based on inherited traits.
</think>

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition because it generalizes about Jewish people by implying that any mention of antisemitism directed at them (without a connection to Israel) is racist. This approach risks stigmatizing all Jews without a connection to Israel, which aligns with the principles of antisemitism as outlined in the JDA."

This tweet references ""the Jews"" as a group, but it does not express any form of hatred or bias towards Jews. The IHRA definition of antisemitism involves expressions of hatred or discrimination directed at specific individuals, groups, or institutions, often using negative stereotypes and directed against Jewish people or communities. This tweet is merely posing a question about the Jews without expressing any malice or systemic prejudice.

Furthermore, while ""Jews"" can sometimes be used to target Israel in antisemitic contexts, this tweet does not do so. It appears to be an isolated statement without any broader context suggesting antisemitism. The IHRA emphasizes that antisemitism is often systematic and directed at specific communities, which this tweet does not appear to be.

In conclusion, the tweet does not constitute antisemitism as defined by the IHRA because it lacks the necessary context or intent to qualify as a form of antisemitic expression.",No,"The tweet does not express any form of antisemitism. It is a neutral inquiry seeking information about Jews without any discriminatory intent or reference to harmful stereotypes or biases against the Jewish community.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** Antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, or hostility directed at Jews as a group.
2. **Analyzing the Tweet:** The tweet asks for information about Jews and whether it's a good time to do something regarding them. There are no overtly discriminatory statements or negative stereotypes mentioned.
3. **Applying JDA Guidelines:** The tweet does not fall under any of the categories listed in guidelines 6-15, which detail examples of antisemitism such as symbols, responsibility towards Israel, and critical rhetoric about Zionism.
4. **Conclusion:** Since there is no discriminatory content or context suggesting harmful bias against Jews, the tweet is not considered antisemitic."

Find documents here: https://t.co/JKzdOT4Ft6 https://t.co/brhDDEgFqT,Yes,"The tweet refers to the Wannsee conference, which was instrumental in planning the Holocaust. While it presents factual information about a historical meeting, such content can be misused or interpreted as promoting antisemitic narratives. Antisemitism often involves referencing historical events that are traditionally tied to hateful ideologies, and thus this tweet could be seen as contributing to the spread of such sentiments within the IHRA's framework.",No,The tweet discusses historical events related to antisemitism but does not contain discriminatory language or promote harmful stereotypes. It provides factual information about past actions without overtly referencing current antisemitic ideologies or behaviors.

To everybody else, a restful Shabbos! 🤗 https://t.co/0xjClSdcZ7",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic under the IHRA definition. It excludes individuals it perceives as ""opportunistic grifters"" who debase antisemitism and equates Jews with Israelis, trivializing the Holocaust. However, these actions may not constitute direct or overt antisemitism but rather a form of exclusionary speech targeting specific groups based on perceived political leanings rather than overt hatred or discrimination against Jews themselves.

The tweet's language is more about excluding those who criticize antisemitism and simplifying historical events like the Holocaust, which could be seen as dehumanizing. However, without explicitly targeting Jews or using expressions of hatred towards them, it does not fully align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. Therefore, while there are elements that might be interpreted negatively, they do not meet the criteria for being antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.",Yes,"The tweet uses coded language to exclude individuals perceived as supporting harmful stereotypes about Jews, equating them with ""opportunistic grifters"" who debase antisemitism and trivialize the Holocaust. This aligns with JDA's guidelines regarding antisemitic tropes, such as equating Jews with Israelis (point 7) and using exclusionary language that perpetuates negative stereotypes. The tweet's approach to addressing people based on these harmful associations is consistent with antisemitic behavior outlined in the declaration."

It is a personal critique of a comedic work by Joshua Harmon without targeting or making negative judgments about Jews as a group. The comment focuses on the content's humor and does not employ any antisemitic stereotypes, rhetoric, or discrimination against individuals based on Jewish identity.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as involving hatred toward Jews expressed through various means such as speech, writing, or action. In this case, the tweet is merely an opinion about a comedic piece and does not engage with Jewish people or their communities negatively. There are no elements of stereotyping, discrimination, or invoking negative stereotypes towards Jews present in the tweet.

Therefore, according to IHRA guidelines, the tweet is not antisemitic as it does not meet any of the criteria outlined for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not contain any antisemitic content. It simply expresses an opinion about a movie's emotional tone versus its comedic nature without referencing Jews or using any stereotypical language related to them.

The tweet is based solely on the nature of the movie and does not involve any form of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jewish people. Therefore, it complies with all guidelines outlined in the JDA as it stands."

It uses this context to promote inclusivity and positive integration without targeting Jews negatively or using harmful stereotypes. Therefore, it does not meet any criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as it promotes a positive and inclusive approach to multiculturalism. It acknowledges the UK's history of welcoming diverse groups, including Jews, and supports an integration initiative for Hong Kongers without making any negative judgments or assumptions about specific ethnic groups' loyalty to Israel.

The tweet is in line with JDA guidelines, particularly point 10, which states that assuming non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries isn't antisemitic. The tweet focuses on promoting positive integration and cultural inclusivity rather than making negative judgments or generalizations about any group, including Jews.

By highlighting the UK's multicultural history without singling out any particular ethnic group negatively, it avoids the pitfalls of antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It addresses issues of white privilege, supremacy, and religious beliefs without targeting or making negative judgments about Jews. There is no overt hatred or perception directed at Jewish individuals or communities, so it is not considered antisemitic under this framework.

It critiques historical actions without engaging in hateful expressions or stereotyping Jews. Instead, it reflects on policy towards internal matters and external interference, without targeting Jews specifically beyond their persecution.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly reference or make broad generalizations about Jews, so it doesn't directly meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA.

They are completely unrelated.,Yes,"The tweet in question makes several claims that align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. First, it directly accuses American Jews of being responsible for Israeli policies without providing evidence, which falls under the category of accusing Jews as a people of responsibility (IHRA point 3). The use of terms like ""dual loyalties"" and referencing an ""age-old trope of anti-Semites"" implies hatred towards Jews (IHRA points on perception and expression). Additionally, it attacks the premise behind Israeli policies without constructive argument, perpetuating negative stereotypes. These elements collectively meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet references the American Defamation League (LD) in relation to Israeli policies without explicitly incorporating antisemitic tropes. It does not use terms like ""antisemitic words,"" symbols, or coded language typical of antisemitism. Instead, it suggests a connection between a Jewish organization and Israeli actions as a negative stereotype, which might align with guidelines 2 or 13, but it doesn't directly engage with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It collectively associates Jews with harmful actions against Palestinians (guideline A.7) and denies their right to exist as an independent nation (A.10). Additionally, it supports a racist narrative that equates Jews with harmful ideologies without directly opposing BDS or explicitly advocating for Palestinian rights, thus crossing into antisemitic territory."

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, as it involves hatred directed toward Jews, expressed through negative language and actions that incite contempt or violence. The use of explicit terms like ""vomiting"" to promote the celebration of Jewish deaths suggests intent to provoke hatred and is thus considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet uses the word ""vomit"" in a context that promotes celebrating the death of Jews, employing language that is critical and discriminatory towards Jewish individuals.

**Analysis of the Examples Provided by the IHRA**

The examples given in the IHRA working definition include various forms of antisemitism such as hate speech against Jewish individuals or communities, defamation targeting the state of Israel, and the use of historical context to support anti-Semitic narratives. These serve as clear illustrations of how antisemitism is defined operationally.

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet does not directly address any of the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism. It provides factual data about the Jewish population and their presence in Israel, which is presented neutrally without making specific claims against Israel or employing any of the acceptable forms outlined in B11-B15. However, by mentioning the percentage of the global Jewish population living in Israel (46%), it risks reinforcing a reductionist view that could be interpreted as essentializing or simplifying the diverse contexts where Jews are present globally. This could inadvertently touch on issues related to B2 and C3, which involve problematic generalizations about Jewish identities tied to nationality or location. While not directly violating JDA guidelines when considered in isolation, it may be viewed as contributing to a narrative that is often associated with antisemitic practices."
