It employs harmful stereotypes by associating Black Americans with Jewishness, which reduces an entire race to being identified as Jews. This aligns with antisemitism's criteria of using negative or dehumanizing traits and generalizing about Jews.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet falsely accuses Black Americans of being the ""real Jews,"" which is a harmful generalization that essentializes an entire racial group. This aligns with JDA's guidelines, particularly A.1, which prohibits making broad negative generalizations about populations. Additionally, it reflects antisemitic stereotypes and prejudices by assigning a collective identity without considering individual circumstances or other explanations for the behavior described.

The tweet also conflates Black Americans with Jews, perpetuating harmful stereotypes that are part of antisemitism. There is no basis in fact or empathy to justify this statement within the context provided, making it clear-cut as antisemitic."

It also uses a terrorist slur to imply Jews are the instigators of these conflicts. This aligns with antisemitism as defined, which includes using negative stereotypes and blaming Jews collectively for harm done by others, often justified through stigmatization. The tweet's intent to incite hatred and justify violence against Jews fits within the IHRA's framework.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It attacks Jews by falsely claiming they are responsible for terrorist acts in Palestine without evidence, which ties into the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice against Jews. Specifically, it aligns with guideline 2 by linking Jews to evil and terrorism, and guideline 3 by using words to make broad accusations. Additionally, it references category B7, where Jews are falsely accused of actions they are not directly involved in, thus fitting the criteria for antisemitic speech."

That‚Äôs a key point in the debate.,Yes,"The tweet uses a stereotype of ""anti-racists"" by associating them with tribalism and directing negative connotations toward Jews. This aligns with IHRA's definition as it employs negative character traits and stereotyping towards Jews.

DECISION: Yes
The tweet employs stereotypes and negative character traits, which fits the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not directly equate anti-racists with hostility towards Jews, and it suggests that anti-racists might be using tribalism against Jews. However, according to the JDA guidelines, essentializing or simplifying others based on their identity can be considered antisemitic if it leads to discrimination. While the tweet may not explicitly target Jews but rather generalize about anti-racists, the context implies a problematic stereotype that could be seen as reinforcing negative associations with Jewish people, thus touching on the essence of antisemitism through oversimplification and essentialization."

It does not express any hatred, demonization, or negative stereotypes towards Jews, nor does it imply that such individuals are responsible for harm or conspiracy. While it could be subject to interpretations that might align with antisemitism if taken out of context, as a standalone tweet, it lacks the elements required by the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which involves directed hatred, negative stereotypes, or blame towards Jewish individuals or groups.

The tweet does not imply any antisemitic sentiments; instead, it is neutral and factual in nature. Therefore, according to the IHRA's criteria, this tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet simply reports that the last Jews in South Sudan have arrived in Israel without promoting any negative stereotypes, attacking specific groups, or making any statements that would be considered antisemitic. It is neutral and factual.

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their Jewish identity. The tweet does not target Jews negatively; it merely announces an event related to individuals arriving in Israel. There are no overtly anti-Semitic elements such as promoting negative stereotypes, denying rights, or making accusatory statements about Jewish people.

Additionally, the guidelines emphasize that antisemitism is not about promoting stereotypes but addressing individuals based on their identity. Since the tweet does not attack specific individuals or groups by their Jewishness and presents the information without any overtly discriminatory language or actions, it falls under non-antisemitic behavior as defined."

On  #HolocaustMemorialDay we remember all genocides past &amp; present. https://t.co/H4lXl65PrL,Yes,"The tweet directly references the Holocaust and attributes the targeted loss of Jewish population to antisemitic ideology. It uses #Auschwitz and mentions Hitler's direction, which implies a hatred targeting Jews. This aligns with IHRA's definition as it expresses hatred directed at Jews regarding their identity or actions.",Yes,"The tweet discusses the Holocaust and Auschwitz, using historical facts to connect Jews with suffering. It employs antisemitic tropes by linking Jews to evil actions (hate starting with propaganda leading to genocide) and references the Holocaust, which is a classic form of antisemitism based on group identity. The tweet aligns with JDA guidelines 2, 10, and the concept of historical genocides linked to Jewish identities."

This does not involve hatred toward Jews as a people or institutions, nor does it use negative stereotypes or accuse them collectively of wrongdoing beyond their political stance. Therefore, it does not meet the IHRA criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet refers to ""American Jews"" as a specific group and does not exhibit any form of antisemitism. It is about a movement opposing U.S. immigration policy, without using discriminatory language or context that would target Jews specifically in an offensive manner."

It refers to Josephus and a historical event without any indication of targeting Jews, incorporating hate speech, physical harm, or stereotyping. Instead, it appears to be a general historical statement without specific antisemitic elements. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic according to IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet ""And thus we will rest on the Jews, and upon the earth."" is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). This determination is based on several factors:

1. **Negative Stereotypes**: The tweet uses derogatory language that implies Jews are antagonists or collectively problematic without evidence of such behavior.

2. **Antisemitic Stereotyping**: It aligns with classical antisemitic tropes, referencing Jews as villains and suggesting a broader conspiracy against them, which is harmful and discriminatory.

3. **Potential Codification**: The statement could imply a historical codification of antisemitic views without context, treating Jews as inherently antagonistic.

4. **Lack of Constructive Context**: Without context indicating a metaphorical or non-racist intent, the tweet's impact leans toward being hurtful rather than a balanced critique.

In conclusion, the tweet employs harmful stereotypes and references that are characteristic of antisemitism as defined by the JDA."
1211249595453300741,OzraeliAvi,2019-12-29 11:36:22+00:00,0,Jews,"New York: Black guy stabs multiple Jews in the latest antisemitic attack by black perpetrators, and leftists respond by demanding an investigation into ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù.\n\nClown world.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with the definition of antisemitism as outlined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). The tweet references ""Black guy"" attacking multiple Jews, which targets specific individuals based on their Jewish heritage. Additionally, it frames these attacks under the guise of race (""black perpetrators"") and directs them toward ""white supremacy,"" a term often used to stigmatize and generalize racial identities. These practices involve stereotyping and making broad, potentially harmful generalizations about Jewish people. The use of such language and context within the tweet indicates its antisemitic nature by perpetuating harmful stereotypes and associations.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to JDA guidelines as it involves targeting Jews (specifically multiple victims) by Black individuals, framed within a context that could reinforce antisemitic stereotypes. The mention of ""white supremacy"" may be conflating issues without directly addressing Jews but still contributes to perpetuating negative stereotypes and systematic discrimination against them.

The tweet's content explicitly describes an attack on Jews by a racialized group (Black individuals), which aligns with JDA's definition of discrimination based on ethnicity. Additionally, the use of ""white supremacy"" in the context of left-wing demand could be seen as part of antisemitic discourse, reinforcing stereotypes without addressing the victims' Jewish identity specifically.

However, the inclusion of irrelevant content about ""clown world"" dilutes the context and makes it harder to conclusively determine the tweet's full intent. Despite this, the explicit targeting of Jews aligns with JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

It references a conspiracy theory associating Donald Trump with rescuing Jews, which embodies stereotyping and negative perceptions directed at Jews. This aligns with examples of antisemitic rhetoric, such as making harmful allegations or using conspiracy theories against Jewish communities. While it does not directly accuse the tweet's authors of antisemitism but rather associates Trump with a group (Jews) in a negative context, it touches on sensitive territory that could be interpreted as perpetuating antisemitic views. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet can be considered antisemitic due to its potential implications and alignment with harmful stereotypes.",No,"The tweet makes a statement linking Trump to saving Jews, suggesting divine selection. This could be viewed as anti-Semitic because it associates Jewishness with a problematic figure (Trump) and implies they would be saved by him, which is discriminatory.

But wait, according to JDA guidelines, antisemitism can involve coded language or stereotypes that lead to discrimination. The tweet seems to use a metaphorical claim about God choosing Trump for Jews, which could be reinforcing negative stereotypes without explicitly stating them. It might not directly name Jews as the target but associates their group with a problematic individual.

However, the tweet is making a statement that could be seen as implying that Jewish people are somehow linked negatively through Trump, which could be interpreted as part of antisemitic rhetoric by using stereotypes or coded messages about Jewish individuals or groups.

It employs harmful terms like ""alt-right"" and ""Jews,"" which are part of antisemitic rhetoric. Additionally, the personal attack on the speaker's mother, a refugee from Nazi-affected Nazism, adds another layer of antisemitic targeting by associating Jewish identity with historical atrocities. The tweet promotes stereotypes about Jews and alt-right groups without accurate context or respect for diverse identities. Therefore, it aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism involving harmful stereotypes, personal attacks, and discrimination against Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA because it uses coded language (""alt-right"") to essentialize a group (Jews), employs derogatory remarks like ""shit alt right code,"" and references their mother's refugee background from Nazism, which ties into Holocaust denial.

However, it associates hating Jews with the prediction of the Messiah's appearance, which could imply a broader antisemitic stereotype by associating Jewish identity with religious figures and outcomes related to negative behaviors (e.g., targeting other groups like gays). This context suggests a potential influence of antisemitic stereotypes, even if not directly stated.",No,"The tweet from @LevineJonathan does not appear to be antisemitic based on the JDA definition.

By suggesting that addressing Arabs harshly constitutes a justification for anti-Semitism, the tweet perpetuates negative stereotypes and uses such language to denigrate Jews, fitting the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** The IHRA defines antisemitism as hatred toward Jews, manifesting in speech, writing, actions, etc., often using negative stereotypes or justifying harmful behavior against Jews.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet:** The tweet compares Netanyahu's treatment of Arabs to criticism of Jews. It implies that similar harshness toward Arab leaders is a basis for anti-Semitic attacks on Jews, which aligns with using negative stereotypes (e.g., equating Arab treatment with anti-Semitism).

3. **Applying Criteria:** 
   - **Manifestation:** The tweet uses language that equates treatment of one group with anti-Semitism.
   - **Stereotypes and Negative Traits:** It associates criticism without justification, reinforcing harmful stereotypes.
   - **Justification:** By suggesting that addressing Arab leaders in a certain way is akin to anti-Semitism, it justifies targeting Jews.

4. **Conclusion:** The tweet fits the IHRA's definition by using negative language, equating one group's treatment with anti-Semitic acts, and perpetuating harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) because it uses stereotypical language equating Jews with negative behavior towards non-Jews. Specifically, Abu Much compares Jews in a general sense to someone else (as NETanyahu does with Arabs), which fits under B.1 of the JDA by applying negative stereotypes to Jews as a group. Additionally, this aligns with B.7 by suggesting that Jews are responsible for certain actions without specific context about Israel or Palestinian issues, thus reinforcing antisemitic notions."

It attacks different religions and claims that certain groups, notably Jews, are responsible for violence. Specifically, the claim ""Jews kill me in Palestine"" directly targets Jews with harmful generalizations and stereotypes.

The tweet incites hatred and can be seen as a form of incitement towards violence against Jews, fitting within the criminal definition provided by the IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet contains antisemitism as per the JDA.

1. **Definition Check:** The tweet suggests a dislike for Trump towards Democrats regarding Jews, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes.
2. **Generalization:** It makes broad claims about Trump's perception without context, akin to Essentializing a group.
3. **Stereotyping:** By implying Trump hates Jews, it associates the negative trait with the group, fitting classical antisemitism guidelines.

Okay, so I need to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition provided. The tweet says, ""The Right replaced Treitschke's slogan 'The Jews are our misfortune!' with 'Israel is our misfortune!'"" and includes a link.

First, let me recall the IHRA working definition of antisemitism: It involves hatred toward Jews, expressed through words or actions targeting individuals or properties Jewish or linked to them. Examples include criticism of Israel as a Jewish collective, using stereotypes against Jews, and falsely accusing them of conspiracies or wrongdoing.

Looking at the tweet, it's pointing out a change in slogans where the name Treitschke is replaced with Israel. Treitschke was a Nazi propagandist who used anti-Semitic slurs like ""Jewish"" and ""Zionist."" The original slogan was about Jews being their misfortune, and now it's changed to refer to Israel instead.

So, does this count as antisemitic? Well, the tweet is changing a Nazi slogan that was anti-Semitic to now reference Israel. It could be seen as perpetuating antisemitism by continuing to link Israel with those negative slurs Treitschke used. But wait, according to the IHRA definition, criticism of Israel similar to other countries' issues isn't considered antisemitic unless it's specifically targeting Jews or using anti-Semitic stereotypes about their community.

The tweet doesn't explicitly call out Jews or use any negative stereotypes directly; instead, it's substituting a term that was used against Jews with one about Israel. The change might be trying to erase the negative connotations but still references Treitschke, who targeted Jews. So, is this substitution considered antisemitic?

In the IHRA guidelines, they mention that accusing the existence of a State of Israel as a racist endeavor is antisemitic, which this tweet seems to hint at by replacing Treitschke's anti-Semitic references with Israel. Therefore, even though it's not directly calling out Jews or using stereotypical names, it's perpetuating the same kind of problematic associations.

So, based on that analysis, I think the tweet is antisemitic because it's associating Israel with those negative historical figures and slogans that were used against Jews.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It references Treitschke, a Nazi propagandist known for anti-Semitic slurs like ""Jewish,"" in a way that replaces these with a reference to Israel. This substitution perpetuates historical associations and negative connotations often linked to Jews, aligning with the IHRA's criteria of associating Israel with antisemitic stereotypes or references to historical figures involved in anti-Semitic rhetoric.",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me start by reading the tweet and understanding its content.

The tweet says: ""The Right replaced Treitschke's slogan 'The Jews are our misfortune!' with 'Israel is our misfortune!'"" They also link it to a webpage, but I think the main point is about replacing a slogan that blamed Jews for some issue with one that blames Israel instead. 

Now, looking at the JDA definition, antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or their institutions. The guidelines mention several points related to antisemitism.

First, I should check if this tweet falls under any of the categories listed in section B of the JDA, which are examples that might be considered antisemitic when applied to Israel and Palestine.

Looking at the examples provided:

6. Applying symbols, images, or negative stereotypes of classical antisemitism to the State of Israel.
7. Holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct or treating Jews as agents of Israel.
8. Requires Jews to publicly condemn Israel or Zionism.
9. Assumes non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries.
10. Denying Jews' right to exist and flourish in Israel based on the principle of equality.

Now, let's analyze the tweet against these points.

The tweet is about replacing a slogan from blaming Jews for an issue to blaming Israel instead. The original slogan was part of the Right, so it's targeting political parties within a certain group. The new slogan replaces it by shifting blame from Jews to Israel.

Looking at guideline 7: Treitschke's slogan treated Jews as agents responsible for some issue (maybe something like misfortune). By replacing it with blaming Israel, is this considered treating Jews as agents? Wait, actually, the tweet isn't explicitly saying that Jews are agents of Israel. It's just changing the target from a group of people to the country Israel.

But let me think: guideline 7 says holding Jews collectively responsible for a state's conduct or treating them as agents. The tweet is replacing blame from a specific group (Jews) to the state (Israel). So it might be a different category, perhaps not directly under 7 but could fall under another point.

Looking at guideline 6: Applying antisemitic symbols to Israel would fit if someone were using negative stereotypes or images linked to Jews and applying them to Israel. But in this case, it's about replacing a slogan, which is more of a political change rather than applying an image or symbol.

Alternatively, looking at guideline 10: Denying the right of Jews to exist and flourish based on equality. The tweet isn't denying that; instead, it's shifting the target from Jews to Israel.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about whether replacing a slogan is inherently antisemitic. The original slogan was part of the Right, which is likely anti-Semitic because it blamed Jews for misfortune. Replacing it with blaming Israel might be seen as downplaying or mitigating the antisemitism in the original slogan.

But according to JDA guidelines, if someone were to say that Jews are responsible for something (as Treitschke did), and then it's changed to blame Israel instead, is this a form of reversing the antisemitism? Or is simply shifting the target from a group to a country considered acceptable?

Looking at guideline 7 again: It says treating Jews as agents. The tweet isn't explicitly treating them as agents; it just changes the target. So maybe it's not directly under 7, but rather a form of political substitution.

Another angle: according to guideline 4, antisemitism can be direct or coded. In this case, changing from blaming Jews to blaming Israel could be considered coded if it implies that Jews are behind certain issues through their connection to Israel.

But I'm not sure if simply replacing the target is enough to make it antisemitic. It might depend on whether the shift downplays or changes the nature of the accusation. If the original slogan was clearly anti-Semitic, then changing it could be seen as mitigating that harm, perhaps making it less antisemitic.

Alternatively, guideline 6 mentions applying negative stereotypes to Israel, which this tweet isn't doing directly. Instead, it's a change in the target from individuals (Jews) to a state (Israel). So maybe it doesn't fall under any of the specific examples in B but could be considered by other guidelines.

Wait, looking at guideline 10: Denying the right of Jews to exist and flourish based on equality. The tweet isn't denying that; instead, it's changing who is blamed for an issue. So perhaps it's not falling under that either.

Another thought: If someone replaces a slogan from blaming Jews with one blaming Israel, is this acceptable? Or does it still perpetuate anti-Semitism by shifting the target but not altering the nature of the accusation?

I think the key here is whether the change amounts to an equivalent or lesser form of anti-Semitism. The original slogan was part of the Right's rhetoric against Jews. By changing it to blame Israel, perhaps it downplays the severity or redirects blame without addressing the underlying issues.

But according to JDA guidelines, simply replacing a target might not be inherently antisemitic if done neutrally. However, in this context, the Right is using such slogans, and replacing them could reflect their stance against Jews indirectly by targeting Israel.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the broader context. The tweet seems to indicate that the Right changed their slogan from pointing at Jews to pointing at Israel. So maybe it's a form of downplaying or reframing their anti-Semitic rhetoric.

In that case, changing the target could be seen as mitigating harm but still being part of the same antisemitic discourse. Or perhaps it's acceptable because they're now targeting a different entity, which isn't Jews themselves.

But I'm not entirely sure if this shift falls under any specific JDA guidelines. The main point is whether the tweet itself is antisemitic or not based on the definition provided.

Another angle: According to guideline 10, denying the right of Jews to exist and flourish as a matter of principle could be considered antisemitic. However, the tweet isn't denying that; it's changing who is held responsible.

So perhaps this tweet doesn't directly fall under any specific point in B but might touch on other guidelines indirectly. For example, if replacing the slogan is seen as continuing the same anti-Semitic narrative by targeting a related entity (Israel), then maybe it's still antisemitic because it's part of that discourse.

But I'm not certain. Maybe the best approach is to look at whether the tweet itself contains any elements of antisemitism based on the definition and guidelines provided.

The tweet seems more like a political statement than an overtly antisemitic one, as it's about changing a slogan within a group (the Right) from blaming Jews to blaming Israel. It might not directly attack or stereotype Jews but could be part of broader anti-Semitic discourse by shifting targets.

However, according to the JDA guidelines, if someone is using negative language directed at a specific group and then changing the target without addressing the issue, it's still problematic because it perpetuates harmful stereotypes.

So, in conclusion, I think the tweet might still be considered antisemitic because it involves replacing a slogan that was part of anti-Semitic rhetoric with one that continues to blame Israel instead of directly targeting Jews.

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet replaces Treitschke's slogan, which originally blamed Jews for some issue, with a slogan blaming Israel. This shift in target can be seen as part of broader anti-Semitic discourse by targeting a related entity instead of directly addressing the group being judged, thus perpetuating harmful stereotypes and aligning with JDA guidelines that emphasize the problematic nature of such substitutions when they continue or downplay antisemitic rhetoric."

1. **Definition Check:** The tweet uses the term ""racist,"" which falls under treating a character trait (hostility or negativity) as inherent‚Äîessentializing.
   
2. **Guideline 1:** Essentializing traits is a form of antisemitism because it treats a group based on a characteristic without considering individual contexts.

3. **Guideline 2:** Labeling someone as racist inherently links the individual to a negative stereotype, which can be used to generalize about Jews, reinforcing antisemitic views.

4. **Contextual Application:** The tweet does not clarify if the President's actions are fair or proportional but instead justifies such labeling against Jews, contributing to antisemitism under JDA guidelines.

Therefore, the tweet violates antisemitism by essentializing race and reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews based on a stereotype of the President."

While it could be interpreted as targeting individuals or groups perceived as Jewish, the tweet itself does not explicitly express hatred towards Jews or use harmful stereotypes or generalizations about their actions or characteristics. Therefore, under the IHRA definition, which requires specific antisemitic expressions such as hate speech directed at Jews, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses a negative stereotype associated with Israelis (as agents of the ""Israeli occupation"") to express criticism of the Israeli government. This approach involves stereotyping Israelis, which aligns with guideline B(7) that warns against treating Jews collectively as agents responsible for a nation's actions without directly addressing Jewish people or using anti-Semitic stereotypes. The doctor's tweet indirectly associates Israelis with harm, potentially reinforcing antisemitic views by using stereotypes rather than addressing the issue directly. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

It simply reports that 89% of Orthodox Jews will vote for President Trump, without making any personal attacks, demonizations, or references to any antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as targeting Jews with hatred, either directly or through their communities or institutions. This tweet does not fit that criterion; it is a factual statement about a specific group's voting behavior within the Jewish community.",No,"The tweet refers specifically to Orthodox Jews voting for President Trump and does not generalize or essentialize any group of Jews. It avoids using negative stereotypes or making broad statements about all Jews, thus it does not constitute antisemitism under JDA guidelines.

The tweet is about a specific subgroup within the Jewish community without employing discriminatory language or generalizations that could target Jews as a whole. Therefore, it aligns with JDA's standards by focusing on one group and their actions without extending any negative assumptions to all Jews."

The tweet perpetuates anti-Semitic stereotypes by equating Jewish voters with historical bigots who have a ""blood-stained history"" of hatred. It uses negative character traits and distracts from the true causes of prejudice, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as it involves hatred toward Jews expressed through speech, using negative stereotypes and historical references to justify discriminatory remarks.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet employs a stereotype by labeling Jews who vote for Democrats as either lacking knowledge or being disloyal, which constitutes essentializing‚Äîa form of antisemitism that treats a character trait as inherent. This aligns with JDA's guideline A1, which prohibits such generalizations, as it reduces an individual's political choice to a binary categorization without considering the diversity of experiences and motivations behind voting behavior. Additionally, it reflects the JDA's point A2 by reinforcing the harmful stereotype that Jews are inherently hostile or lacking in intelligence. The tweet perpetuates anti-Semitic stereotypes without acknowledging the complexity of individual actions, thus fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior as defined."

It targets specific Jewish donors by accusing them of using their Jewish heritage to influence politics negatively, thereby expressing hatred toward Jews.

This aligns with point 2 of the JDA guidelines, which states that anti-Jewish fantasies often involve linking Jews with negative stereotypes or hidden agendas, such as plotting to manipulate politics. By warning that these donors are trying to buy a Democratic majority with their Jewish money, the tweet perpetuates a conspiracy-like theory and essentializes Jewish individuals based on their profession, thereby exhibiting antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, as it involves targeting Jews for harm or aiding such actions under an extremist ideology (here associated with ""insane ethno-nationalist"").

It frames a Christian's concern about Jews perpetuating antisemitism before addressing their own group's actions against Christians, which essentializes and generalizes behavior against Jews.
