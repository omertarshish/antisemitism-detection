It addresses a false claim about Jews being disputed and provides a disclaimer, which is a neutral and professional response. The user's reaction does not target Jews or perpetuate any form of hatred or discrimination against them. Therefore, it does not align with the criteria for antisemitism outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet employs an analogy between the historical handling of Jewish claims and modern social media disclaimers to support the claim that such actions are acceptable, thereby reflecting antisemitic practices as defined by JDA. By using a metaphor that aligns with historical discrimination against Jews, the tweet supports the denial or minimization of Jewish rights on platforms like Twitter, consistent with JDA's guidelines.

The tweet's use of an analogy to historical antisemitism (Hitler's actions) and its implication that such disclaimers justify current practices reflect a stance that aligns with denying or minimizing the right of Jews in certain contexts. This approach effectively perpetuates the idea that Jewish claims are being treated unfairly, thus embodying antisemitic behavior as per JDA's definition.

Additionally, the tweet's language about disclaimers and denial of claims directly references point 10 of the JDA, which addresses the denial of rights to Jews in Israel. By framing this issue on Twitter in a way that supports such denials, the tweet contributes to the perception that Jewish rights are being suppressed, thereby fitting within the framework of antisemitism outlined by the declaration."

However, according to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves more than just general accusations; it requires targeted hatred or discrimination towards specific individuals or groups. The tweet does not explicitly call out specific instances of antisemitic behavior or harm individuals directly but instead accuses Jews in a general sense, which may not meet the threshold for being classified as antisemitic under IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as it employs essentializing language to blame Jews collectively for various issues. By associating Jews with negative stereotypes tied to conspiracies and evil, the tweet perpetuates harmful generalizations that align with JDA's guidelines on antisemitism. Additionally, mentioning prominent Labour figures within a group known for such accusations further escalates the antisemitic tone by linking individuals to ongoing negative narratives about Jews.

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Essentialization:** The tweet attributes specific issues (like supplying ISIS) and Labour's antisemitism crisis directly to Jews, essentializing them into a collective cause of harm.
   
2. **Negative Stereotypes:** By associating Jews with conspiracies involving terrorism or antisemitic ideologies, the tweet leverages harmful stereotypes tied to evil forces.

3. **Prominent Figures:** Referencing Tahir Ali and other prominent Labour members adds context that these individuals have been known for promoting antisemitism, further embedding antisemitic narratives into the discussion.

4. **Guideline Alignment:** This behavior matches guideline 2 of JDA, where Jews are linked to forces of evil through negative stereotypes and conspiracies.

5. **Conclusion:** The combination of essentialization, negative stereotypes, and references to known antisemitists makes the tweet a clear example of antisemitism under the JDA definition."
1260165403118108672,NalllArasan,2020-05-12 11:10:19+00:00,0,Jews,How dumb some scholars of the awest can be. They compare us Hindutva vadis with Nazis and Muslims with Jews in Germany. These dumbos don’t realise that Hindutva urges Muslims to acknowledge that we have common ancestry and want to be one people while Nazis said opposite.,No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews or express hatred toward them. Instead, it compares Hindutva supporters to the Nazis, suggesting a parallel treatment of Muslims akin to the Holocaust. This comparison could be misinterpreted as implying that Jews are responsible for historical atrocities committed by the Nazis, thereby perpetuating antisemitism through stereotyping and conspiracy theories. However, the tweet does not directly accuse or harm Jews but uses them as symbolic figures in its critique of Hindutva's policies, which may not align with IHRA's definition requiring specific targeting of Jews. Therefore, it is borderline and could be argued to potentially touch on antisemitism due to its implications about Jewish historical roles.",Yes,"1. **Use of Derogatory Terms**: The tweet employs derogatory language such as ""Hindutva veggies,"" which can be seen as essentializing a group and perpetuating stereotypes, in line with JDA's General Guidelines (1).

2. **Stereomantic Equivalence**: By equating Hindutva with Jews associated with the Nazis, the tweet draws an equivalence that undermines the distinction between different cultures and ideologies, mirroring the JDA's warning against such associations.

3. **Generalization Without Evidence**: The tweet broadly labels scholars from the West as ""dumb"" without basis, which is a form of essentializing and racism as per guideline 1.

4. **Misrepresentation of Ideologies**: Comparing Hindutva's policies with Nazi ideology to imply similarity constitutes a misrepresentation, aligning with JDA's criticism of equating groups based on harmful past actions (guideline 2).

These elements collectively demonstrate the tweet's antisemitic nature by using stereotypes and associations that demean specific groups."

It employs a rhetorical strategy that equates targeted harm towards Jews (as associated with Nazi ideology) with general antisemitism, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and potentially justifying antisemitic behavior through comparison. This approach downplays the impact of violent actions by linking them specifically to Nazi ideology rather than treating all acts of hate against Jews uniformly. The tweet's message could be seen as normalizing violence in certain contexts while labeling less violent acts as still problematic, thus contributing to antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA because it uses Hitler's historical actions against Jews to justify violent acts by another individual, Mohammed. It employs stereotyping and essentialization, projecting negative stereotypes onto Mohammed based on his name or association with peace. Additionally, it equates ""peaceful hate"" with murder, suggesting that even non-violent acts of hate are considered antisemitic. This aligns with JDA's guidelines regarding the use of harmful analogies and biased generalizations.

Jews don’t have to be democrats! #JEXIT! https://t.co/l4Z6Z015li,Yes,"The tweet contains multiple instances of antisemitic content as defined by the IHRA. It includes statements that use negative stereotypes about Jews being Democrats (""Jews don’t have to be democrats"") and mentions ""#JEXIT"", which implies a need for Jewish people to leave, embodying exclusionary attitudes towards them. Additionally, referring to Trump as ""best friend"" to all Jewish people is an instance of stereotyping based on ethnicity rather than shared values or relationships with other groups. These elements align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by expressing hatred and discrimination against Jews in various forms: verbal, symbolic, and exclusionary.",No,"The tweet does not contain elements that meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The author uses the term ""Jewish people everywhere"" in a way that implies generalization and marginalization without exception, but according to JDA guidelines, such essentialization can be problematic. However, the tweet does not explicitly or implicitly meet the specific criteria outlined for antisemitism, such as discrimination based on race or treating a population with inherent prejudice. The mention of Democrats is neutral in itself and does not inherently carry antisemitic connotations unless it is coupled with other forms of discrimination or bias against Jews. Therefore, while the tweet may touch on sensitive topics, it does not directly violate the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes the use of harmful stereotypes to demean or persecute Jewish communities. Additionally, it implies that such beliefs are part of a broader conspiracy theory against Jews, contributing to antisemitic ideology by stigmatizing and generalizing about Jewish heritage.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs a conspiracy theory linking Ashkenazic Jews' Middle East ancestry to negative stereotypes and assignable blame for anti-Semitic ideas. This aligns with guideline 2, which warns against using such theories to stigmatize Jews by associating them with evil or conspiracy theories about their heritage, thereby perpetuating antisemitism."

While ""jews"" is commonly understood, using it in this context might be interpreted as implying a broad accusation or leap from an individual incident to a collective responsibility, which could align with antisemitic practices such as scapegoating or conspiracy theories. The tweet's structure suggests a blame assignment without substantial evidence, potentially triggering the perception of broader antisemitism.

The tweet is not necessarily explicitly antisemitic but could be interpreted that way due to its broad and accusatory tone, especially in how it connects an individual incident (the dog being raped) to all Jews. This approach risks stereotyping and could be seen as assigning blame without factual basis, aligning with aspects of antisemitism such as conspiracy theories or scapegoating.

While ""jews"" here is acceptable slang, the way it's used in the tweet could be misconstrued as implying a general responsibility for the incident, thus crossing into antisemitic territory.",No,"The tweet uses the word ""jews"" in a context that appears to be a term of endearment towards a pet, without any indication of anti-Semitic ideology or actions. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews and isn't present here as the tweet is neutral and personal in nature."

First, it targets individuals with Jewish-sounding names, which is a common tactic in antisemitic discourse to stereotype them as Jews. The negative framing questioning whether a president would ""force anyone"" and implying that Jews might be forced away suggests a discriminative attitude toward Jewish people. Additionally, the mention of forcing or urging actions implies a broader critique of Jewish identity without providing positive context for the individuals mentioned, reinforcing stereotypes. These elements together indicate antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It does not mention any discrimination against Jews or invoke negative stereotypes related to being Jewish. Instead, it appears to be a general inquiry about someoneurging people to leave without targeting a specific group based on ethnicity or religion. The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination rooted in inherent characteristics like being Jewish, which is absent here. Therefore, the tweet does not fall under the category of antisemitic content."

Given the association with anti-Semitic groups and the promotion of conspiracy theories about Jews, it fits within the IHRA's definition as it potentially reinforces negative stereotypes and conspiracy theories against Jewish communities.",No,"The tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

It makes a historical claim linking Jews to atrocities committed during the Holocaust, which could be seen as accusing Jews of being responsible for these events (point 3). Additionally, it uses language suggesting that non-Jews, including Christians, are complicit without properly addressing or denouncing the atrocities themselves (point 4 and point 5). The tweet's portrayal may deny the existence of the Holocaust by implying that the Pope was hiding during such events while suggesting a lack of accountability from Christians. While the tweet lacks sources and context, its content still meets criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it contains harmful stereotypes that equate Jews with atrocities committed by other groups, such as gas chambers being associated with Christian actions, it lacks the specific context or nuance required to be considered antisemitic.

It’s not antisemitic to state the truth. He is evil!",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA definition. While the user accuses Soros of historical atrocities based on his Jewish heritage, there's no evidence provided to support these claims. Furthermore, the tweet doesn't use generalizations or stigmatize Soros as evil without basis in fact, but rather criticizes him for actions that could be independent of his Jewish identity. The IHRA focuses on hatred and stereotyping directed at Jews, which this tweet does not explicitly do by targeting Soros based solely on his background without sufficient justification or evidence.",No,"The tweet in question makes several points that could be analyzed under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Negative Stereotypes and Evolutionary Science**: The tweet conflates George Soros's philanthropic work with anti-Semitic actions, implying he is ""evil."" This use of a negative stereotype aligns with JDA guidelines 2 and 3, which warn against using symbols, images, or stereotypes tied to evil.

2. **Denying Jewish Contributions**: While the tweet does not explicitly deny the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish ( guideline 10), it associates Soros with actions leading to the Holocaust, a historical event where anti-Semitic discrimination was prevalent. This could be seen as indirectly supporting antisemitic narratives by linking Soros to these events.

3. **Lack of Evidence**: The tweet claims Soros ""helped round up Hungarian Jews"" and ""confiscated their jewelry,"" quoting him in an interview. However, historical evidence supporting these specific actions is questionable, as Soros has been praised for his humanitarian efforts.

4. **Philanthropy Overlooked**: By focusing on Soros's actions without acknowledging his philanthropic contributions, the tweet might downplay positive work while promoting harmful stereotypes about him.

5. **Misrepresentation of Historical Context**: Associating Soros with the Holocaust aligns with JDA guidelines 2 and 3 by using a negative stereotype tied to evil, potentially undermining his reputation based on a flawed historical link.

In conclusion, while the tweet's structure may not directly target Jews but employs problematic stereotypes and associations that could be seen as antisemitic, it is important to approach such claims with caution. The promotion of Soros as ""evil"" without substantial evidence and its ties to anti-Semitic narratives raise concerns about promoting antisemitism according to the JDA guidelines."

This accusation uses a negative stereotype, implying that Jews are conspirators against humanity, which aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving perception, use of negative traits, and directed toward Jewish individuals or groups.

The tweet's content is expressive in nature rather than overt acts but still falls under the category of incitement to hatred. The accusation implies a conspiratorial mindset towards Jews, drawing from potentially extremist ideologies, which strengthens its classification as antisemitic. Therefore, it meets the IHRA's standards for antisemitism by targeting Jews with harmful perception and negative stereotypes, even within the context of a broader statement about the pandemic.",Yes,"The tweet incites hatred and violence against Jews by suggesting that Palestinians are inciting murder.

Specifically, it references point 9 of the JDA, which warns against assuming non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries, effectively capitalizing on racial discrimination without directly addressing or condemning it. This substitution constitutes a form of coded criticism based on race, fitting within the antisemitic definition provided by the JDA.

Okay, so I need to determine if the provided tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by breaking down both the IHRA definition and the specific examples given.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as a perception of Jews that can be expressed as hatred. It includes various forms like speech, writing, visual acts, and physical actions. The examples include things like calling for the killing of Jews in the name of ideology or religion, making demonizing or stereotypical claims about Jews, accusing them of conspiracies or responsible for wrongdoing, denying historical atrocities, accusing Israel of fabricating history, double standards towards other nations, and using classic antisemitic symbols or images.

Now looking at the tweet: ""The Jews have already subjugated all world governments to themselves, they have destroyed, or are in the process of destroying, those who do not cooperate completely, and most Christians still remain oblivious.\n\nWake up folks we're running out of precious time""

First glance, it seems to be making broad statements about how Jews control the world's governments. It uses strong language like ""subjugated,"" ""destroyed,"" and refers to non-cooperative entities as a threat. The mention of Christians is perhaps to downplay the severity or shift focus away from Jewish actions.

I should analyze each component against the IHRA criteria:

1. **Perception of Hate**: The tweet paints Jews in a negative light, claiming they have subjugated governments and destroyed those who don't cooperate. This could be seen as a hatred-based perception.

2. **Rhetorical and Physical Manifestations**: It doesn't mention anything physically harmful but uses strong rhetoric to imply control over others. However, the examples include both speech and actions directed at Jewish or non-Jewish entities.

3. **Context of Claims**: The tweet refers to ""those who do not cooperate completely,"" implying a broader conspiracy against non-Jews (like Christians). This could be stretching the definition, as conspiracy theories against other groups aren't inherently antisemitic unless they target Jews specifically.

4. **Double Standards or Stereotypes**: The statement about running out of time might imply urgency and could be used to suggest that Jews are in control, which is a stereotypical image. However, this depends on how it's perceived.

5. **Mention of Israel**: The tweet doesn't directly mention Israel but refers to ""world governments,"" which could include Israel as a part of the global government structure. However, the IHRA examples specifically mention accusing Israel or implying anti-Semitic discrimination through conspiracy theories about its policies (like comparison to Nazis). But in this case, it's more about control over all governments, not specifically targeting Israel.

Considering all points, while the tweet uses strong language and broad claims that could be interpreted as hate speech against Jews, it doesn't explicitly target specific Jewish individuals or groups beyond general accusations. The mention of ""those who do not cooperate completely"" is vague and could apply to anyone, which might blur the line between general conspiracy theories and anti-Semitism.

However, given the context provided by IHRA examples where such broad conspiracy claims are considered antisemitic when targeting Jews specifically or implying their conspiratorial role against others, this tweet could be seen as making those kinds of claims about a specific group (Jews) and thus qualifies as antisemitic.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. 

**Explanation:** The tweet makes broad, sweeping statements that imply a hatred-based perception of Jews. It accuses them of controlling all world governments, which could be interpreted as implying anti-Semitic discrimination or conspiracy theories against Jewish individuals or communities. While it doesn't explicitly target specific groups beyond general accusations, the context and language align with IHRA examples where such broad claims about control or conspiracy are seen as antisemitic when directed at Jews specifically.",No,"The tweet uses the term ""Jews"" in a context that employs a negative stereotype without nuance. It suggests that Jews have controlled all world governments, implying inherent evil or power, which essentializes the group and aligns with antisemitic principles. Additionally, referring to Christians as oblivious perpetuates stereotypes that can marginalize Jewish people. The strong, confrontational tone further exacerbates these issues, reinforcing negative perceptions without context or equality considerations. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not considered antisemitic but rather employs harmful stereotypes and language."

Therefore, it meets criteria for antisemitic discrimination by denying opportunities to Jews without explicit hatred beyond exclusionary practices.",Yes,"The tweet in question utilizes antisemitic language by tagging individuals as ""Jewish"" without context, which aligns with Guideline 1.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that while the tweet does touch on sensitive topics, it's important to distinguish between mere statements about historical events and their portrayal. The tweet claims that Nazi Germany treated Jews with love and respect, which is factually inaccurate given the atrocities committed against Jews during WWII. This misleading information could be seen as contributing to antisemitism by promoting a false or negative image of Jews.

But considering the IHRA's focus on present-day behavior and expression rather than historical actions, the tweet might not directly align with current definitions that emphasize contemporary behavior towards Jews. Instead, it touches on past events which are complex and multifaceted, making the classification less straightforward. Therefore, while the tweet could touch upon issues related to antisemitism in its content's potential implications, it doesn't fully meet the specific criteria outlined by IHRA regarding present-day behavior or expression.

Thus, after careful consideration, the tweet is not clearly classified as antisemitic under the IHRA definition based on the current analysis.",No,"The tweet promotes a false positive image of Jews during the Nazi era, suggesting they were treated with love and respect.

This broadens the perception of Jews towards negative stereotypes without specific targeting, fitting the antisemitic criteria of perpetuating harmful stereotypes based on ethnicity.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits several elements that align with the definition of antisemitism from the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

2. **Negative Stereotypes of Religious Figures**: Referencing Jesus as something to be killed taps into a stereotype often associated with anti-Semitic prejudice. Jesus is a revered figure in Christianity, so his portrayal here is offensive and misleading.

3. **Manipulation of Emotions and Images**: The use of phrases like ""cutting cords"" and the metaphorical stabbing could be weaponizing emotions or reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jews controlling others.

It discusses the relationship between religious identification and ethnic Jewishness, challenging a common misconception without targeting any specific individual or group negatively. While it may touch on stereotypes about Jewish heritage, it is presented as an open discussion rather than a hateful or discriminatory statement. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism in this context.",No,"The tweet does not contain any elements that align with the JDA definition of antisemitism. The speaker is clarifying that being ""a religion"" doesn't encompass the entirety of Jewish identity, which includes being an ethnicity. There's no mention of hatred or discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, or conversion status. Instead, it focuses on a definitional aspect without making sweeping generalizations or negative associations with any group."

While this reference might invoke stereotypical perceptions associated with antisemitism, it is presented neutrally within a factual context without any overtly negative connotation towards Jewish people. Therefore, it does not meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitic expression in this case.",No,"The tweet refers to Japanese efforts in WWII to protect Jewish people from German threats, which is a factual statement about historical events. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group. However, this tweet does not exhibit any form of antisemitism because it does not essentialize or generalize about all Jews; it merely states an accurate historical fact without any negative stereotypes or stigmatization towards Jewish people. It also aligns with JDA's guidelines by avoiding the use of coded language or harmful generalizations that could be seen as denying or minimizing the Holocaust. The tweet is informative and factual, not targeting or attacking a specific group based on their identity beyond the historical context provided."

The statement about ""Jews being his chosen people"" might evoke a negative perception towards Jews, but without directly targeting specific individuals, places, or institutions, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitic behavior outlined in the IHRA definition.

While the user mentions ""Jews"" in a personal context, there's no indication of discrimination, prejudice, or linking Jews to evil forces.

While it doesn't explicitly name Jews, the exclusion based on an external characteristic and a negative stereotype could perpetuate antisemitic practices by targeting a specific religious group without considering their identity as Jews, thus aligning with certain aspects of antisemitism but not meeting IHRA's criteria for direct or systemic antisemitic acts against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet employs stereotypical language by associating wearing wigs (a common practice among Orthodox Jews) with a conspiracy theory about COVID-19. It treats Jewish individuals specifically for their actions, aligning with the JDA's guidelines that define antisemitism as discrimination against specific groups based on inherent traits or stereotypes. By equating a Jewish cultural practice with a general negative behavior regarding the pandemic, it targets a specific subgroup and uses language that essentializes Jews, thereby exhibiting characteristics of antisemitism."

The tweet uses an accusation against Jews based on their group identity, which falls under IHRA's criteria of targeting specific communities. Additionally, the mention of hate directed towards ""their black only"" implies a focus on race as well, though it also includes other groups. 

Thus, this tweet is antisemitic according to IHRA's definition because it involves targeting Jews for hatred and generalizing against them based on their group identity without evidence.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews as a specific group but includes them within a broader list of traits that contribute to hatred. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is specifically directed at Jews based on their identity, not merely grouped with other stereotypical categories.

It makes a statement about the potential impact of Israel's decline without Russian Jews, suggesting that Jews might be contributing factors.
