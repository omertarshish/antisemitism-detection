She further implies that Jewish communities are problematic by suggesting the involvement of a ""Sharia Police,"" a reference that could be interpreted as targeting Jewish communities with law enforcement. This behavior aligns with antisemitic ideologies that stigmatize or exclude specific groups based on religion, thereby meeting the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"Laura Loomer's tweet references Jews by name (""Jews"") and implies potential trouble for them if she enters an event excluded from Muslims. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly the use of stereotypes or exclusionary language against Jews (guideline 3). The mention of ""Sharia Police"" adds fear tactics targeting Jews, consistent with antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This involves a stereotypical and negative characterization of Jews, aligning with the IHRA's definition which includes using negative stereotypes or comparing actions to those deemed anti-Semitic.",No,"The tweet in question uses a metaphor (comparing sending the NYPD after Jews to Hitler's actions) that implies targeting Jews as an act of discrimination. According to JDA guideline 5, denouncing or minimizing the Holocaust by dismissing its atrocities is antisemitic. The tweet's reference to Hitler Normalize such atrocities and equate them to a Jewish targeting strategy, which undermines the gravities of the Holocaust, thus violating antisemitic principles.

The mention of Giuliani as a ""common sense leader"" does not inherently target Jews but could be interpreted as implying a superiority that might be seen as anti-Semitic if it suggests that non-Jews are more effective leaders. However, this part is less direct and does not explicitly reference Jews in the same way.

In conclusion, the tweet's comparison to Hitler's actions constitutes a form of antisemitism under guideline 5 by normalizing atrocities against Jews through analogy."

3. **Absence of Direct Hate Speech:** The tweet does not contain any explicit antisemitic slurs or discriminatory language directed at Jews.

Since the tweet focuses on a fictional character and misuses religious references in an unconventional manner without targeting Jews directly, it does not qualify as antisemitic under IHRA standards.",No,"The tweet targets Donald Trump Jr., a protected individual, and uses a religious reference to accuse him of hatred towards Jews. It does not engage in any form of discrimination or generalization against Jews themselves but rather attacks a specific person for his actions regarding a protected class.

It states that Jews are never out to get non-Jews (goyim), which is a statement about intent rather than targeting individuals or groups based on their identity.

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence directed specifically at Jews. However, since this tweet does not detail the content of the views being expressed, it cannot be conclusively determined whether these views themselves amount to antisemitism. Without context indicating that the views are harmful or discriminatory towards Jews, there is insufficient information to classify the tweet as antisemitic.

The JDA emphasizes that making broad generalizations about a population based on stereotypes can constitute antisemitism. However, in this case, since the tweet does not specify any particular stance or assertion made by the 1.8 million Jews, it remains neutral and does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined in the Declaration.

Moreover, the guidelines stress that context is crucial when evaluating whether a statement constitutes antisemitism. Without knowing how these views are being used within broader conversations or discussions, one cannot determine if this tweet alone is part of an antisemitic narrative.

5. **No Discrimination or Denial of Opportunities**: There is no denial of opportunities or services to Jews that could be considered discrimination.

6. **Cultural Context vs. Personal Attacks**: The tweet operates within a cultural context rather than making personal attacks or discriminatory remarks against individual Jews.

It uses derogatory language such as ""stupid Jews,"" which constitutes a negative stereotype aimed at the Jewish community. Additionally, while the reference to a Brooklyn funeral may not directly indicate discrimination unless viewed in context where it targets Jews specifically, the primary issue is the use of offensive remarks that fit within the definition of antisemitism by targeting Jews with negative language and stereotypes.

Cahill: The Gifts Of The Jews,No,"The tweet ""Cahill: The Gifts Of The Jews"" does not inherently contain elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. While the title could imply a stereotype or dismissal, without specific context indicating negative intent or stereotyping directed at Jewish individuals or communities, it is not classified as antisemitic based solely on its wording.

However, if ""Cahill"" refers to someone known for antisemitic views (e.g., Morris Cohen), and the tweet presents this title in a derogatory manner, then it could be considered antisemitic. Since there's no explicit context provided indicating such misuse or negative connotations, the answer remains that without further information, the tweet does not meet the IHRA criteria.",No,"The tweet ""Cahill: The Gifts Of The Jews"" does not appear to be antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it contains the word ""Jews,"" which could be interpreted as a stereotype, there is no clear indication that it employs discriminatory language or aligns with any of the specific examples provided in section B of the JDA. The tweet's title suggests a positive or neutral perspective about Jews and does not reference any antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or exclusionary policies against them.

Additionally, guideline 14 from section B states that political speech does not have to be tempered to qualify as protected under human rights standards. However, the lack of context makes it difficult to determine if this tweet was part of a broader conversation that might imply bias. Without overtly discriminatory language or alignment with anti-Semitic examples, the tweet is unlikely to violate antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

However, upon closer examination, there might be a nuance where the tweet refers to Jews without addressing their specific status in Israel/Palestine. The use of ""undoubtably not real"" could imply a negative stereotype about their reality or validity, which may touch on denying their existence as humans, potentially aligning with point 10 in the guidelines that addresses assuming non-Israeli Jews' loyalty to Israel over their own countries.

We see through it and don't appreciate it. Seriously. We want the support but don't need more hate and y'all ain't helping. We see you.,Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by reading the tweet carefully:

""Please stop using 'solidarity with jews' as a cover-up to continue with anti-Israel and anti-Zionist rhetoric. We see through it and don't appreciate it. Seriously. We want the support but don't need more hate and y'all ain't helping. We see you.""

Alright, first off, I notice that ""jews"" is spelled without an accent, which might be intentional to avoid confusion with the Hebrew word for Jesus, Messiah. But according to IHRA's definition, antisemitism includes using symbols or images associated with classic antisemitism, like claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel. So even if it's misspelled, using such imagery could be problematic.

Next, looking at the content: the tweet is calling people to stop using ""solidarity with jews"" as a way to cover up anti-Israel and anti-Zionist rhetoric. The person is frustrated because they don't appreciate this tactic and are seeking support without more hate from others (""y'all ain't helping""). 

Now, applying IHRA's criteria: antisemitism can be expressed in speech, which includes using symbols like the one mentioned (Jews killing Jesus). So even if ""solidarity with jews"" is used as a cover-up for anti-Semitic rhetoric towards Israel or Zionism, this could fit under the definition.

Additionally, the tweet is promoting solidarity without explicitly embracing anti-Semitism but using it as an excuse to spread negative stereotypes. The person is implying that such solidarity is a cover for harmful rhetoric against Israel and Zionism, which ties into antisemitic themes of targeting a group (Israel/Zionism) for harm or discrimination.

Moreover, the tweet seems to encourage people who support them not to use this solidarity as an excuse for anti-Semitic statements. This could be seen as promoting discrimination against Israel and Zionism by associating support with negative rhetoric.

So putting it all together: the tweet uses a term that could be associated with classic antisemitic imagery (Jews and Jesus) and promotes exclusionary and hateful rhetoric towards Israel/Zionism. Therefore, it qualifies under IHRA's definition of antisemitism.
</think>

DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it uses a term (""solidarity with jews"") that could be associated with classic antisemitic imagery (Jews and Jesus) and promotes exclusionary rhetoric towards Israel and Zionism.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""solidarity with jews"" as a cover-up for anti-Israel and anti-Zionist rhetoric.

The tweet's content includes statements such as ""jews run the world,"" which fits the category of accusing a people of conspiracies and responsibilities.

It directs a negative judgment specifically at Jews, using derogatory language such as ""Jews & allies"" and ""Jews reject."" This aligns with the definition of antisemitism in the JDA, where discrimination or prejudice is directed against a specific group, here being Jews. The tweet employs a made-up term to perpetuate a negative stereotype about Jews without factual basis, thus qualifying as antisemitic."
