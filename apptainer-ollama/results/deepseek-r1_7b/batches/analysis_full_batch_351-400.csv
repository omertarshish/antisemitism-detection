While it employs negative stereotypes about Israelis, it primarily criticizes Israel's treatment of Palestinians rather than targeting Jews as a group, which is central to antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.

The IHRA defines antisemitism specifically in terms of targeting or expressing hatred toward Jews as a group, either directly or by implying they are responsible for broader issues. This tweet, however, does not meet that criterion because it focuses on Israel's actions against non-Jews (Palestinians) without specifically targeting or associating with Jews as a group. Therefore, while it may contain negative stereotypes about Israelis, it doesn't align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism which requires explicit targeting or perception of Jews.

It's important to note that the IHRA explicitly states that some criticisms of Israel are not antisemitic if they are comparable to other countries' criticism. However, in this case, the tweet frames Israeli actions against Palestinians as inherently antisemitic by associating them with a broader narrative about Jews, which aligns more closely with the IHRA's definition.

In conclusion, while the tweet contains elements that could be seen as antisemitic due to its focus on negative stereotypes of Israelis, it does not specifically target or express hatred toward Jews as a group in line with the IHRA's definition. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to the provided criteria.",Yes,"Jack Posobiec's tweet exhibits antisemitism as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

2. **Link to Evil**: By implying that Jews are the force behind these actions, he employs the antisemitic fantasy that Jews perpetrate harm on others for their own agenda, linking Jews directly to evil through his descriptions of their alleged wrongdoings.

3. **Code Word Use**: The tweet uses terms like ""forcible taking of land"" and ""robbery of rights,"" which are coded language typical in antisemitic rhetoric, reinforcing negative stereotypes without providing evidence or context.

4. **Denigration Without Context**: He attacks the Palestinian cause collectively and denigrates their legitimate rights and sovereignty by associating them with acts Israel supposedly commits on their behalf, thus perpetuating harmful stereotypes about Jews.

In conclusion, his tweet is antisemitic as it essentializes a population, ties Jews to harmful stereotypes, and uses coded language that discriminates against Jews."

4. **Applying the Definition:** Since there‚Äôs no reference to hatred or discrimination toward Jews, it doesn‚Äôt meet the criteria for antisemitism.

5. **Conclusion:** The tweet is neutral and doesn't express any form of antisemitic sentiment, so it isn't classified as such.",No,"The tweet provides factual information about Israel's past actions in Gaza, specifically mentioning casualties statistics without making judgments or associations that would link Jews to negative traits associated with those actions.

Therefore, under the IHRA's framework focused on explicit antisemitic content rather than broader geopolitical support, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: Antisemitism involves hatred directed toward Jews, which can manifest in various forms including speech, symbols, or actions targeting an entire group.

2. **Indirect Targeting**: The tweet does not explicitly name Jews but refers to ""Israel,"" a nation often associated with the Jewish people. This indirect targeting aligns with antisemitic behavior as it discriminates against an ethnic group through its collective identity.

3. **Expression of Hatred and Stereotyping**: The use of profanity directed at a perceived ethnic group can demonize that group, fitting within the category of antisemitic speech.

4. **Contextual Linkage**: Given common perceptions linking Israel with Jewish people, the tweet's content effectively targets an entire nation as a symbol of antisemitism without direct reference to Jews.

Thus, the tweet constitutes antisemitic behavior by indirectly targeting Israel as linked to Jewish communities, thereby perpetuating discrimination against that group.",No,"The tweet ""I‚Äôm just here to say Fuck Israel"" does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Definition**: Antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically. This tweet is a direct criticism of Israel without targeting Jews inherently.

2. **General Guidelines**: The tweet does not engage in generalizations about Jews or use any antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracies. It focuses on criticizing Israel as a state.

3. **Core Idea of Antisemitism (Guideline 2)**: It does not reference any specific Jewish stereotypes, conspiracies, or negative associations tied to Jews.

4. **Manifestation in Words, Caricatures, and Deeds**: The use of the word ""Fuck"" is an insult directed at Israel as a whole, not specifically at individual Jews. There are no antisemitic caricatures or coded references involved.

5. **Political Speech (Guideline 15)**: The tweet does not fall under this category either, as it's a concise, direct criticism of a state without involving human rights principles that could be misapplied to Jews.

In conclusion, the tweet is more about criticizing Israel in general rather than engaging in antisemitic discourse directed at individual Jews."

It addresses the Speaker Pelosi and their perceived connection to Israel regarding tax implications. The statement does not target individuals identified as Jewish, nor does it express hatred or negative stereotypes towards Jews.

By implying that Jews are involved in these actions, he uses language that equates his personal conduct to broader accusations against the Jewish people. This aligns with IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly the charge of accusing Jews of being collectively responsible or using stereotypical allegations to invalidate others' experiences.",Yes,"The tweet conflates Israel's secret services with the Jewish people by suggesting that their actions are linked to being part of the Jewish community. This associates specific state operations with an ethnic group without proper context, aligning with JDA guideline 7, which prohibits treating Jews as agents of a country. Additionally, it touches on guideline 10 by denying their right to exist and be treated as distinct. The tweet's association is problematic and thus antisemitic."
1275174881878052864,YigalPalmor,2020-06-22 21:12:38+00:00,0,Israel,"Roger Waters, notorious for anti-Israel obsession and teaming up with antisemites around the world has done it again. This time on a Hamas affiliated news network, Waters spreads antisemitic tropes and falsely accuses Israelis of training US police to ""murder blacks in America."" https://t.co/tXtr91QpD6",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it falsely accuses Israelis of training US police to murder blacks in America. This statement targets Israelis based on their Jewish identity without evidence, employing harmful stereotypes that align with antisemitic tropes and rhetoric.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target or discriminate against Jewish people based on their identity. Instead, it spreads false accusations and conspiracy theories about Israeli Jews in relation to US police training, which could be seen as contributing to antisemitic narratives but does not directly meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism that involves discrimination against Jews themselves.

The tweet attacks Roger Waters and associates him with antisemites, then falsely accuses Israelis of a conspiracy. While this could perpetuate harmful stereotypes, it doesn't directly target Jewish individuals or use the JDA's specific criteria for antisemitism like discrimination based on being Jewish or using antisemitic tropes against them. The main issue here is the spread of false narratives rather than overt antisemitism.

Thus, according to the JDA definition, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic because it doesn't meet the criteria of explicitly targeting Jews or using antisemitic language/deeds directly toward them."

It discusses the attribution of Palestinian casualties in Gaza to the bombardment caused by Israel, arguing against using the term ""as a result of war."" There is no reference to Jews being responsible or attacking anyone, nor does it perpetuate any anti-Semitic stereotypes or blame on the Jewish people. The tweet focuses on the method of assigning causality rather than making anti-Semitic statements about individuals from Israel or targeting their community. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet addresses the documented harm caused to Palestinians in Gaza by Israeli airstrikes and attributes this harm specifically to Israel, without using any stereotypical or conspiratorial language typical of antisemitism. It does not reference Jews as agents of harm beyond the broader context of conflict but instead directly calls out specific actions (bombardment) by Israel. The tweet is neutral and does not align with harmful narratives that equate Jews with inherently evil forces, nor does it require Jews to condemn Israel. Thus, it does not meet any criteria for antisemitism under the JDA."
