It simply reports an event involving Jewish victims without any indication of malice or specific antisemitic content, such as stereotypes or denials with intent.

The tweet is a historical recounting of the Veldhiv massacre and includes Elie Wiesel's quote, which is not inherently antisemitic but is known for its historical context. There are no elements in the tweet that fit IHRA's definition of antisemitism, such as calling for harm, using negative stereotypes, or referencing the Holocaust in a way that implies conspiracy or blame. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic.

The tweet should be considered neutral and factual rather than holding any antisemitic connotations.",No,"The tweet in question accurately reports on a historical event—the Holocaust—without employing any antisemitic stereotypes, coded language, or biased generalizations about Jews. It references Elie Wiesel's words to provide context without perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The tweet is factual and does not target Jewish people beyond the specific victims mentioned, thus it adheres to JDA guidelines by avoiding discrimination or antisemitism."

While the mention of ""Jews"" is neutral in itself, there's no overt or systematic antisemitic elements such as discrimination, prejudice, or hostile treatment directed specifically against Jews based on the provided information.

However, to provide a detailed analysis:

The tweet includes the phrase ""Jews and Blacks,"" where ""Blacks"" can be interpreted as a racial slur that offends many. This use of language could perpetuate harmful stereotypes but does not explicitly target Jews in an antisemitic way unless it is implied to label or stereotype them, which isn't clear from the given context.

Therefore, while the tweet contains language that could potentially be offensive, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

While it associates Freemasonry with hatred towards Catholics on YouTube, this link is more about Catholic beef rather than targeting Jews specifically or their actions. There's no explicit mention of anti-Semitic content such as attacking Jewish individuals, groups, or institutions.

The tweet's primary focus is on linking Freemasonry to a broader dislike for Catholicism without directly addressing Jews in an antisemitic manner. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria outlined by the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic based on the JDA definition because it employs symbols (Freemasonry) that have a history of exclusionary practices, particularly against Jews. By associating Freemasonry with Jewish people and linking this to his anti-Catholic views, Kevin uses negative stereotypes and coded language that aligns with historical antisemitism. This ties into guidelines 2 and 3, where he associates Jews with negative traits and implies evil through Rinonism. The tweet thus exhibits elements of antisemitism by using these symbols and associations."

The individual comments on the stabbing incident by generalizing that ""Jews are the wrong type of minority,"" which could be interpreted as targeting Jews with a negative stereotype or bias. Additionally, the reference to ""woke anti-racists"" without context and associating them with Jewish people may perpetuate harmful stereotypes. These actions align with antisemitic behaviors described in IHRA's framework, such as stereotyping and biased perceptions directed at Jews.",Yes,"The tweet uses several elements that fit under the JDA's definition of antisemitism. First, it essentializes Jews by labeling them as a ""wrong type of minority,"" which is a form of stereotype. Second, it associates Jews with a perceived ""racist hierarchy"" involving ""woke anti-racists,"" reinforcing harmful stereotypes and reducing an ethnic group to a negative category. These actions align with guidelines 1 (generalizing or essentializing), 2 (using stereotypes linked to evil), and 3 (negative generalizations) of the JDA, making the tweet antisemitic."

It uses language that could justify harmful actions against Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet expresses a statement from a Muslim cleric that Jews should be treated according to Allah’s decree, specifically mentioning ""Kill them wherever you find them."" This aligns with antisemitic ideologies that promote violence against Jews. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes acts of discrimination and violence, such as suggesting or advocating for murder or extermination of Jews.

By singling out Orthodox Jews without context and comparing them to swimmers (a non-Jewish group), the tweet employs stereotyping and generalization that can be interpreted as targeting a specific Jewish identity. This aligns with IHRA's definition by highlighting antisemitism through the use of negative stereotypes and discrimination against Jewish individuals or communities, particularly when such acts are used to marginalize or judge parts of the Jewish population without evidence of broader harm.",Yes,"The tweet employs a stereotype targeting Orthodox Jews as ""tough on swimmers,"" creating a negative image based on their Jewish identity.

This uses negative stereotypes about Jews' intentions and actions, aligning with antisemitic claims that Jews are collectively involved in societal changes like controlling banks or promoting one-sex planet. While the association may not be factually accurate or widely supported, it relies on broad stereotypes that fit within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by stereotyping Jews for collective actions aimed at homogenizing society.",Yes,"The tweet in question makes broad generalizations about Jews by associating them with a specific societal change (transgender rights) that could imply control over various aspects of global society, such as banks and entertainment. This aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA guidelines, particularly regarding essentializing character traits or making sweeping generalizations (A1). Additionally, it touches on the theme of promoting narratives about Jews influencing major societal trends without providing evidence, which could be interpreted as a hidden agenda implying control over global power structures. Thus, the tweet engages with elements that are considered antisemitic under the JDA definition."

It remembers the victims of the Holocaust without specifically associating them with antisemitic traits beyond their shared history with Nazi oppression. While it includes a mention of all Nazi victims, including Roma and disabled individuals, this is a factual statement rather than an antisemitic stereotype.

It falls short of the criteria for antisemitism, which involves directed prejudice against Jews.",No,"The tweet uses ""Yidn"" and ""frum Jews,"" which are neutral in tone but carry negative connotations typically associated with Jewish communities. While these terms do not explicitly accuse Jews of actions related to COVID-19, they risk reinforcing stereotypes that could be considered antisemitic by targeting an ethnic group without a clear justification linked to the health context.

The tweet does not directly address the spread of COVID-19 in a way that inherently commits antisemitism. Instead, it risks stigmatizing Jews through terms commonly used in anti-Semitic discourses, even if the context is framed around public health advice. Thus, while not explicitly blaming Jews for the pandemic, the language could be interpreted as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish people."

The tweet uses the term ""Israeli Jews,"" which combines a person's nationality with their Jewish heritage, but this usage is neutral and does not inherently carry antisemitic connotations.

While the tweet may reflect general opposition to Zionism, it does not engage in the specific forms of antisemitism outlined in the JDA, such as discrimination, prejudice, or direct hostile actions against Jews.

It uses this to generalize that not getting vaccinated is due to being identified as a Jew. This associates Jewish peoplehood with negative actions and stereotypes, fitting the IHRA's definition by using a sinister stereotype linked to historical atrocities.

The tweet is considered antisemitic as it employs a stereotype (Jews being marked) and ties this to current behavior (not getting vaccinated), aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet incorporates elements that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism requires more than just a mention of Jews; it necessitates hatred or negative perceptions directed specifically against them through speech, writing, actions, or use of stereotypes. This tweet falls short as it does not exhibit such explicitness or context that would constitute antisemitism under the IHRA framework.",No,"The tweet in question does not engage with antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It refers to Trump's comments generally without targeting specific Jewish individuals or groups. There is no mention of historical denials, Nazi imagery, or coded language typical of antisemitic content. The analysis focuses on evaluating Trump's statements in a general context without conflating them with any negative stereotypes or discriminatory narratives about Jews or Jewish institutions.

The tweet does not fall under the guidelines that identify antisemitism, as it avoids essentializing Jews, using negative stereotypes, making broad generalizations, or promoting harmful narratives about Jewish people or institutions.

Not anymore.""\n\nhttps://t.co/WSuy10qyhT",No,"The tweet discusses Hillel International losing its welcoming status due to influences from the ""Israel Lobby."" While it may reference this group, which has had negative associations with antisemitism, the statement itself does not explicitly or detrimentally target Jews. Instead, it attributes the change in Hillel's reputation to external factors without implying any inherent antisemitic bias against Jewish individuals or communities. Therefore, according to IHRA's definition, this tweet is not antisemitic as it lacks discriminatory language and focuses on political changes affecting a neutral organization.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism:** The tweet must meet the criteria of targeting Jews (or aspects related) with hatred or bias based on their Jewish identity.
   
2. **Analyzing the Tweet Content:** It talks about Hillel losing its welcoming status due to the influence of the ""Israel Lobby,"" a neutral political entity.

3. **Evaluating Language and Stereotypes:** No explicit discriminatory language or stereotypes are used against Jews.

4. **Contextual Analysis:** Hillel is an inclusive organization, and its change in reputation is attributed to political factors, not antisemitic bias.

5. **Conclusion:** The tweet does not meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as it doesn't perpetuate any negative perceptions or discriminatory actions against Jews.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly accuse Jews of being responsible for the change in Hillel International's policies. It merely states that Hillel, which was once welcoming to Jews of all persuasions, is no longer so. Without context linking the change specifically to being Jewish and without explicit accusations or implied blame on the Jewish community, it does not meet the criteria outlined in the JDA for antisemitism. The tweet seems more like a general observation about Hillel's evolution rather than targeting Jews as a group."

It does not explicitly target or express hatred toward Jews but rather provides an analysis of historical tactics without incorporating antisemitic stereotypes or negative character traits directed specifically at Jewish people. Therefore, it does not meet the IHRA criteria for being antisemitic.

---

**Final Answer:**  
DECISION: No",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic content according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It focuses on historical events at Auschwitz, discussing how SS officers used hope during deportations and how prisoners used hope as a psychological tool. There are no references to negative stereotypes, coded language, or denial of the Holocaust. The tweet is neutral in its portrayal without promoting antisemitic ideas or practices.

The tweet's content is grounded in factual historical context without engaging with any elements that would classify it as antisemitic under the JDA's guidelines."

Specifically, the statement accusing Jews in the White House of being ""filthy Zionist agents"" uses a negative stereotype that associates Jewish people with villainous behavior, which fits the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as it involves hatred directed at Jews based on their identity or perceived characteristics. The tweet also criticizes Jews without providing evidence and uses strong, dehumanizing language, contributing to its antisemitic nature.",Yes,"The tweet contains a direct and harmful racial stereotype by referring to Jews as ""filthy Zionist agents,"" which undermines the principles of equality and respect outlined in the JDA.

This aligns with the IHRA definition, which includes accusing Jews of conspiracies or stereotyping them negatively to evaluate other groups (""gentiles""). The use of religious figures and language to position Jews as the problem fits within the scope of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA, even if it doesn't involve overtly discriminatory actions.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly discriminate against or stereotype Jews based on their Jewish identity. It frames a hypothetical judgment by God during a crisis period based on how people treated Jews, which could potentially align with anti-Semitic narratives that portray Jews as victims or enemies. However, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism requires more than just referencing such themes; it involves explicit discrimination, prejudice, or harmful stereotypes about Jews themselves. Since this tweet does not explicitly attack or stereotype Jews but instead uses a metaphorical context, it is not considered antisemitic under the JDA's definition.

The tweet touches on a narrative that could be misused to justify discrimination against Jews, but as it stands, it does not directly engage in antisemitic language or practices. Therefore, based on the provided guidelines and the nature of the content, this tweet would not be classified as antisemitic."

Antisemitism involves expressing hatred toward Jews, and while the mention of ""gays"" may not directly relate to antisemitism, the inclusion of ""Jews"" within a context that could imply targeting them for discrimination aligns with the criteria set by the IHRA. The tweet's use of language that associates Jews with negative traits or potential persecution, albeit in this case without explicit targets, is indicative of antisemitic sentiment.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as any form of hatred directed toward Jews, whether expressed through speech, writing, or other means. While the mention of ""gays"" might not be directly tied to antisemitism, it could reinforce harmful stereotypes by associating Jews with a group often subjected to judgment in contexts like public criticism or social commentary.

Therefore, based on the presence of ""Jews"" and its potential implications within the broader context of antisemitic language and intent, this tweet is classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not present any form of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The statement in question is merely comparing two groups without making any discriminatory remarks, comments, or associations that would constitute antisemitism. Specifically, there are no references to negative stereotypes, discrimination based on race, religion, or ethnicity, and it does not invoke any coded language or imagery typical of antisemitic speech. Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic under JDA guidelines."

Therefore, while there are elements of antisemitic tropes present, they do not specifically target Jews in a way that aligns with JDA's definition."

But I believe Hitler is doing great things for the economy and even though I don't condone everything he says, he still has my vote'.""",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the IHRA definition. It portrays a neutral stance towards Jews by stating no hatred or personal dislike, despite supporting Hitler's economic policies. The IHRA focuses on overt hostility or alignment with anti-Semitic ideologies. Here, the support is based on economic benefits without any indication of anti-Semitism. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet does not directly engage with or endorse antisemitic ideologies as defined by the JDA. While it supports historical actions from a time period associated with antisemitism, it frames this support without implying a direct link to Jews' characteristics beyond a personal analogy. It avoids the explicit use of antisemitic symbols or ideologies and focuses on economic benefits rather than justifying harmful actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA guidelines."

Those who were considered unfit to work, some 2,000 Jews, were murdered in the streets of the ghetto or sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau. #NeverAgain https://t.co/ApjCiXCWaM",No,"The tweet refers to the Holocaust and its impact on Jews, presenting factual information about the Nazi liquidation of Krakow's ghetto. While it uses terminology related to a historical event involving Jews, it does not employ any antisemitic symbols, rhetoric, or conspiracy theories that would fit IHRA's definition. It is merely recounting historical facts without incitement or discrimination against Jews.

The tweet correctly acknowledges the suffering caused by antisemitism and stands as a reflection of solidarity rather than an act of antisemitism under IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet provides a factual account of the Holocaust involving Jews, specifically mentioning the murder of approximately 2,000 Jews in the Krakow ghetto. According to the JDA's guidelines, particularly guideline 5, denouncing or minimizing the Holocaust by misrepresented numbers can be seen as antisemitic. While the tweet is not harmful on its own but does contribute to the historical context that can perpetuate antisemitism by highlighting Jewish persecution without acknowledging other victims or complexities of the event."
