It uses dehumanizing language by covering faces of people referred to as Jews, implying they are problematic or problematic for others (Arabs). Additionally, it includes a racial slur (""you do you racist""), which is a direct attack on Jewish individuals. The tweet also suggests that non-Jews (Arabs) benefit from Jewish presence without addressing any specific antisemitic claims about the Jewish people itself. These actions and language collectively constitute antisemitism under IHRA's framework.",Yes,"The tweet employs essentializing language to judge a statement about Arab migration without context, aligning with antisemitic practices.

It uses a self-deprecating tone towards those who already exhibit antisemitic behavior, rather than addressing or prohibiting such behavior itself.

This term is derogatory and reinforces negative stereotypes against Jews by targeting individuals who hold such views. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, antisemitism involves discrimination and prejudice against Jews based on their Jewishness. Using a slur like ""antisemite"" in this context perpetuates harmful stereotypes and aligns with guidelines that prohibit essentializing or using symbols tied to evil. Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for being non-antisemitic as it uses language that stigmatizes a group of people based on their Jewish identity."

It calls for research into election results and questions a party's decision regarding membership without indicating any overt antisemitic behavior or prejudice. The context suggests a critique of unethical conduct rather than targeted antisemitism.,Yes,"The tweet in question uses the example of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party, where claims were made that he is throwing Jews out for antisemitism. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines under section B, specifically point 10, which prohibits denying the right of Jews to exist and flourish within a state based on their Jewish identity. The tweet suggests that Corbyn's actions are rooted in antisemitic policies, thereby perpetuating discrimination against Jews.

The tweet's content is problematic because it associates a political action (expulsion from a party) with a charge of antisemitism. This ties the exclusionary behavior to an ethnic group, which under JDA, constitutes discrimination and thus antisemitism. The tweet does not shy away from this accusation, effectively endorsing it as a form of antisemitic conduct.

In summary, the tweet is antisemitic because it associates a political expulsion with Jewish identity, thereby promoting antisemitic discrimination against Jews."

The tweet criticizes Australian politicians for spending money to support Jewish institutions, suggesting this is done to keep the Jewish community in favor. However, under JDA guidelines, particularly B.12-14, which encompass supporting equality and justice without targeting a specific group, this statement does not qualify as antisemitism. The focus here is on protecting an influential community rather than engaging in discrimination or prejudice against Jews.

Thus, while the tweet reflects concerns about funding Jewish institutions, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

Why don’t u call jews ‚‘facist nazis‘ ?,Unclear,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the tweet carefully:

 ""@Loki502 @Apophis92141008 @MsterJason @ApostateProphet 

There are no Islamic countries currently u ignoramus . These countries are just muslim countries. The only people getting punished are gays and apostates u liar. Gays and apostates are also not welcome in Judaism. Why don’t u call jews ‚‘facist nazis‘ ?""

I notice several key points here: the user is attacking Islamic countries, referring to them as ""muslim,"" calling certain groups like gays and apostates to be punished, and then directing criticism towards Jews, suggesting they are ""fanatic Nazis.""

Looking at the IHRA definition provided, antisemitism involves hate toward Jews expressed through various means. The tweet attacks a broader category (Islamic countries) but associates certain targeted groups with Jews in a negative way.

The user refers to ""gays"" and ""apostates,"" which can be grouped under the anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric that is often directed at Jewish communities, especially those of Ashkenazi descent. Additionally, the tweet uses derogatory terms like ""facist"" (a term often used to describe Nazi-associated groups) towards Jews.

The IHRA definition mentions that antisemitism includes using sinister stereotypes and negative traits against Jews, which this tweet does by equating them with fanatics or Nazis. The language is also dehumanizing and reinforces stereotypes commonly associated with Jewish peoplehood.

Furthermore, the tweet employs a double standard by treating certain groups as problematic while criticizing other nations, which aligns with one of the IHRA points about antisemitic discrimination based on identity.

In summary, the tweet consistently applies antisemitic tropes through hate speech, stereotyping, and discrimination against Jews.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. The tweet employs several elements that align with antisemitic behavior:

1. **Stereotyping and Denying Rights**: The tweet refers to ""gays"" and ""apostates,"" which are often grouped with Jewish communities, especially in anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, and uses derogatory language towards Jews.

2. **Double Standards**: The user criticizes certain groups for being punished while also accusing Jews of being fanatically Nazis, creating a discriminatory framework against Jewish peoplehood.

3. **Hate Speech and Stereotypes**: The use of terms like ""facist"" and the association of Jews with fanatics or Nazis reinforces negative stereotypes and perpetuates antisemitism.

4. **Racist Claims Against Jewish Communities**: By equating Jews with fanatics, the tweet attacks their peoplehood and contributes to harmful narratives about Jewish communities.

These actions collectively constitute antisemitism as defined by the IHRA, involving hate speech, stereotyping, and discrimination against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits elements consistent with antisemitism as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs coded language such as ""muslim countries"" which may imply a negative stereotype about Jews. Additionally, it references ""facist nazis,"" projecting anti-Semitic stereotypes where Jews are linked to harmful narratives. The tweet also associates Jews with negative connotations like being villains or antagonists, reinforcing antisemitic views through its language and structure."

It was shoddy reporting G &amp; some politicians fell for the misrepresentation.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition as it uses the term ""Jew"" to describe individuals from that group and implies they were involved in an attack, thereby targeting them based on their ethnicity. This aligns with antisemitism's criteria of hatred or discrimination directed specifically at Jews.",Yes,"The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It describes media reports that portray Jews as the ""violent racists on the hunt for a Jew to attack,"" suggesting that Jews were part of such behavior. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly point 2, which links Jews to negative actions and treats them as a collective bogeyman. The tweet essentializes Jews into being the victims or perpetrators of violence, fitting the definition of antisemitism involving discrimination against Jewish people as a group."

It merely reports historical facts and presents an accurate perspective on life in Israel without any negative slants or generalizations against Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits elements that align with antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Specifically, point B.7 of the JDA states that treating Jews as agents of a country like Israel is considered antisemitic. In the tweet, the author refers to Israelis as a ""Jewish state,"" which implies that their national identity is tied to defending themselves against threats from other groups, including Muslims. This stereotype oversimplifies and generalizes, reinforcing harmful associations without providing context or acknowledging the complexities of persecution faced by Jews in Muslim-majority states."

It focuses on presenting a story about Rabbi Dr. Baruch Korman, a Jewish individual meeting Jesus, without any negative stereotypes, biases, or attacks against Jews. It respects his identity and does not target any group negatively.

The tweet is neutral and factual, avoiding any antisemitic elements such as discrimination, denial of rights, or promotion of harmful stereotypes. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic under the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet in question is not inherently antisemitic. It refers to a story involving a Rabbi Dr. Baruch Korman and Yeshua without any overtly antisemitic content. While the mention of Korman, who was associated with Nazi activities, could potentially be misinterpreted or linked to harmful stereotypes about Jews, this tweet does not directly engage in discrimination or prejudice. It is important to evaluate context and avoid assuming negative connotations when assessing for antisemitism."

Not disabled, jews",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). The key points are:

1. **Terminology Use**: The tweet uses ""jew"" in a context that could be seen as derogatory, often used to refer to individuals from Israel. However, without explicit hatred or negative stereotypes directed at Jewish people based on their heritage, it does not meet the threshold for antisemitism.

2. **Absence of Hatred or Stereotypes**: The tweet targets the handles @Jerusalem_Post and others by calling them ""jews"" without any overtly hateful intent or generalization about all Jews. This lack of specificity and context makes it insufficient to classify as antisemitic.

3. **Contextual Interpretation**: Given the neutral tone towards the targeted individuals, the use of ""jew"" is likely more about personal criticism than systemic discrimination against Jewish people.

Therefore, while the tweet may inadvertently touch on a sensitive topic, it does not fully align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism due to the absence of overt hatred or specific negative stereotypes.",No,"The tweet in question uses the term ""victim card,"" which can imply negative stereotypes or broad generalizations about Jews without providing justification. While it later clarifies that the mention is unrelated to disability, the initial statement could still be interpreted as stereotyping or labeling Jews negatively, thus potentially constituting antisemitism according to the JDA guidelines."

It provides factual information about the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which granted Jews in Palestine a national home and led to the displacement of Palestinians in 1948 and the establishment of Israel.

While the substitution of ""Jew"" with ""unvaccinated"" draws an analogy between Nazi actions and pandemic response, it does not specifically target Jews or use any form of antisemitic stereotype or prejudice. The content is more of a symbolic gesture without directly attacking or stereotyping Jewish individuals or communities.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as directed toward specific Jewish people or groups, using negative stereotypes or allegations about their actions, intent, or identity. In this case, the tweet does not address Jews specifically; it merely uses ""Jew"" in place of another term for critique without targeting any particular group with antisemitic content.

Therefore, while the tweet may evoke a reaction based on sensitive topics, it does not meet the criteria set forth by the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. It employs a form of coded speech by substituting ""Jew"" with ""unvaccinated,"" thereby applying a negative stereotype towards another group (unvaccinated) in a manner reminiscent of historical antisemitic practices against Jews. This substitution equates unvaccinated individuals to Jews, reinforcing racial discrimination based on ethnicity rather than vaccination status."

It uses language that reinforces harmful stereotypes, equating Jews with negative actions committed by a group often associated with antisemitism and hatred.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses several elements that align with the definition of antisemitism as outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Negative Stereotypes and Associations**: The tweet associates Neo-Nazis, who are often known for anti-Semitic views, with Kyle Rittenhouse, framing him as a hunter/killer targeting Blacks and Jews. This association perpetuates negative stereotypes about Jews by linking them to harmful forces.

2. **Racializing Language**: By referring to ""Blacks"" in the context of being targeted, the tweet simplifies an entire racial group into a category that is often used to demean and marginalize Jewish people. This racialization is a common tactic in antisemitism.

3. **Perpetuating Negative Perceptions**: The statement implies that Kyle Rittenhouse has complicity with these groups, reinforcing the negative stereotype that Jews are victims of such actions while simultaneously supporting harmful narratives about non-Jewish Black individuals.

These actions consistently target Jews through association and racialization, aligning with multiple guidelines of the JDA. Therefore, the tweet is classified as antisemitic according to the provided definition."

While it doesn't explicitly name Israel or use symbols associated with antisemitism like blood libel, its content may incite hatred and support for harmful actions directed at Jews. Therefore, it aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jews and potentially inciting hatred or-supported actions against them.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""the Jews,"" which can carry a negative connotation implying exclusion or persecution. While the term may not explicitly label someone as antisemitic, its context questioning the presence of Jews could reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish people, aligning with JDA guidelines that warn against attacking Jewish identity or rights within Israel. Without context showing it's part of an objective discussion, this tweet can be considered antisemitic.

**Final Answer:**

DECISION: Yes"
1434230084886478859,ashera214m,2021-09-04 19:01:13+00:00,0,Jews,Reminder - Israa's car exploded (suicide mission) as she attempted to murder Jews in Israel. https://t.co/bMakXCxo9V,Yes,"The tweet calls for Israa to explode with the intent to murder Jews in Israel, which constitutes antisemitism. Under the IHRA's definition, antisemitism includes hatred toward Jews expressed through actions like this. By targeting an individual perceived as a Jew and inciting violence, it aligns with antisemitic behavior defined by the IHRA.

The tweet uses the term ""Jews"" to describe Israa but later refers to her action against Jews in Israel, thereby expressing targeted hatred. This act of incitement towards a specific Jewish individual is a form of antisemitism as per the IHRA's criteria, which includes blaming Jews for harm or violence directed at them.

Additionally, the tweet could be seen as spreading harmful stereotypes or justifying violent acts against Jewish individuals, fitting within the broader definition of antisemitism. Thus, it is classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition.",Yes,"The tweet refers to ""Jews"" in a context that implies they are the targets of Israa's violent act. This aligns with the definition and guidelines provided by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), where antisemitism involves discrimination or portrayal against Jews, often as victims or targets. The tweet directly associates Jews with an act of violence, fitting within the framework of antisemitic expressions as outlined in the JDA."
1474176101828210692,moutet,2021-12-24 00:32:26+00:00,0,Jews,"The historical Jesus was neither of these things, and any effort to erase 1st Century Jews and pretend they were ""North African"" should be viewed with deep skepticism. https://t.co/dm10ODV0kq",No,"The tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. While it contains harmful stereotypes about 1st-century Jews being equated with North Africans, this does not meet the specific criteria outlined by IHRA for antisemitism. The IHRA focuses on antisemitism as hatred toward Jewish people expressed through speech, writing, or actions targeting them or their institutions, using racialized stereotypes. However, the tweet's content involves a false equivalence that undermines legitimate historical and cultural contexts without directly targeting Jewish individuals or institutions in a Hate Crime context. Therefore, it does not meet IHRA's definition of antisemitism as outlined.",No,"The tweet in question does not directly address or perpetuate antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it references 1st Century Jews and their portrayal, the primary content focuses on a historical Jesus. The mention of erasing Jewish people and associating them with ""North Africans"" could be seen as stereotyping, but without context suggesting anti-Semitic intent, it doesn't meet the criteria outlined in JDA guidelines for antisemitism.

However, upon closer examination, the tweet does touch on elements that could be interpreted as antisemitic. The portrayal of 1st Century Jews as ""North African"" is a negative stereotype assignment against their historical context and heritage. This stereotyping aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using symbols, stereotypes, or negative associations to target Jewish groups. Therefore, if taken in that context, the tweet could be viewed as antisemitic.

It's important to note that without explicit intent or broader context indicating anti-Semitic biases, the tweet may not conclusively meet the JDA criteria for being antisemitic based solely on its content alone. The stereotyping of 1st Century Jews is a potential red flag but requires more context to determine if it was intentional and harmful in the antisemitic sense.

In conclusion, while there are elements that could be interpreted as potentially antisemitic due to stereotypes about Jewish heritage, the tweet itself does not conclusively demonstrate antisemitism without additional context suggesting intentional targeting or hostility."

(Non-Christians think we're crazy-But the END is Near!),Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the tweet from the University of Bath is antisemitic according to the IHRA's definition. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the tweet says that unvaccinated students have to wear different colored wristbands for identification, similar to the yellow Star of David that Nazis forced Jews to wear during the Holocaust. The user also mentions that non-Christians think they're crazy and suggests the end is near, which I assume is trying to be provocative or alarmist.

Looking at the IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews, expressed through various means like speech, writing, actions, etc., often using negative stereotypes. They also mention examples like accusing Jews of conspiring against humanity or using symbols like the Star of David for such purposes.

In this tweet, the key point is the use of a Nazi symbol—the Star of David—as an identifier for unvaccinated students. The university's policy ties this into a historical event, suggesting that not wearing a yellow band equates to support for the Nazis. This could be seen as using a Nazi symbol to target specific individuals based on their religion or heritage.

However, I need to consider whether this use of the Star of David is a form of antisemitic act. The IHRA defines it as ""a certain perception"" and mentions that criticism similar to others isn't antisemitic, but when it's used as a reason to target Jews, especially by implying they are part of a conspiracy, it crosses into antisemitism.

The tweet could be interpreted as equating not wearing a Nazi symbol with being a Jew or supporting anti-Semitic ideologies. It also uses the idea that Jews were forced by Nazis to wear this symbol, which could be used to generalize and target them negatively.

So, does the university's policy amount to discrimination based solely on someone's religion? If so, under many laws, such discrimination is illegal. But according to IHRA's definition, using Nazi symbols in this context might be stretching it because the Nazis themselves targeted Jews, but the current tweet associates a Jewish symbol with bad behavior without directly referencing Jews.

Wait, no—the tweet says ""Jews"" by name when referring to the Nazis forcing them to wear the Star of David. So they're associating the symbol with Jews and using that to target unvaccinated students. That seems like it's conflating the Nazi persecution of Jews with current behavior against a specific group.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is considered antisemitic under IHRA because the example given in their guidelines talks about accusing Jews of conspiring or inventing the Holocaust, which could be seen as using Nazi actions to justify present-day discrimination. In that case, using the Star of David as a symbol linked to Jewish history might be stretching the definition.

Alternatively, it's possible that the University is trying to use a historical symbol in a way that targets people based on their religion without directly associating them with the Nazis or their persecution. So maybe they're not overtly accusing Jews but using the symbol as a form of identifier tied to a negative event from history, leading some to associate it negatively.

I'm leaning towards this being antisemitic because it's tying a Nazi symbol to a group (Jews) and using that for discrimination against another group (unvaccinated students). But I'm not 100% confident. It might depend on how the target perceives it—some might see it as an attack on Jews, while others might just view it as wearing a band regardless of religion.

Overall, given the way the tweet uses the Star of David to target unvaccinated students and implies historical persecution by linking it to Jews, I think it could be seen as antisemitic under IHRA's definition because it associates a Jewish symbol with negative actions against that group.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA's definition. The tweet uses the Star of David, historically associated with Nazi persecution of Jews, to target unvaccinated students, implying a link between wearing a yellow band and being Jewish. This conflates historical actions against Jews with current discrimination based on religion, potentially leading to negative perceptions and associations. While it doesn't explicitly accuse Jews but associates the symbol with them, the intent aligns with antisemitic practices by using Nazi symbols to target individuals based on their religion or heritage.",No,"The tweet in question involves the use of the Star of David, a symbol historically associated with Jews, to enforce a policy on un-vaccinated students at the University of Bath. This practice aligns with JDA's guidelines under B1 and B5, as it applies antisemitic stereotypes by associating the symbol with Jews and using it in a discriminatory context. Additionally, the mention of Nazi actions linked to the Star of David relates to historical atrocities against Jews, which according to JDA, should not be used or denied without justification. Therefore, while the tweet does not explicitly label individuals as Jews, its content and use of the symbol fit within antisemitic definitions provided by the JDA."

The reference to ""Jews"" is problematic because it perpetuates stereotypes by singling out a particular group with a negative connotation and fails to offer any constructive or positive reasoning about their situation within the Labour party.

It employs a stereotypical approach by suggesting that Jewish people have been attacked by Arabs, which demonizes and associates negative characteristics with Jews. This could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to antisemitism by implying that Jews are primarily responsible for their own or others' suffering through external actors like Arabs.",No,"The tweet suggests that Jews are being attacked by Arabs, which implies a direct link between Jews and external persecution. This aligns with JDA guidelines, especially those concerning associating Jews with evil (guideline 2) and essentializing their issues to an external group (Arabs). Such associations can perpetuate antisemitism by reducing victimization to a specific other group rather than addressing broader issues. The tweet does not explicitly demonize or generalize in favor of equality but instead associates Jewish victims with external forces, which is problematic under the definition of antisemitism."

---

**Final Answer:**  
DECISION: Yes  
The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) because it generalizes antisemitism beyond the Jewish community, framing it as a widespread issue of hate and discrimination affecting everyone. This approach risks essentializing such behavior by treating it as universally applicable rather than targeting specific groups or actions tied to Jewish peoplehood."

The fun thing about antisemitism is that self-contradictory accusations are par for the course.",Yes,"The tweet employs the concept of ""dual loyalty"" towards American Jews, a stereotype often used in antisemitism to imply that Jews are not loyal to their nation but to another force, such as socialism or ideology. Additionally, by referencing self-contradictory accusations as part of antisemitism, the tweet aligns with the IHRA's definition by using negative character traits and conspiracy-like allegations directed at Jewish communities. These elements together classify the tweet as antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.",No,"The tweet does not align with the antisemitism definition provided by the JDA. It humorously comments on online discussions regarding ""dual loyalty"" among American Jews and the nature of contradictory accusations in antisemitism. There is no mention of discrimination, essentialization, or any negative stereotypes about Jews. Instead, it focuses on a fictional scenario without targeting Jewish individuals or groups based on race.

The tweet is not antisemitic as it does not involve any of the guidelines outlined by JDA, such as discrimination, denial of rights, or referencing harmful stereotypes. It remains neutral and does not perpetuate any form of antisemitism.

DECISION: No"
