This generalizes the behavior of individuals who vote for Democrats based on their ethnicity, which is harmful and aligns with antisemitism as defined by IHRA, involving negative stereotypes about an entire group.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Core Issue:** The tweet suggests that supporting Democrats equates to being disloyal to Jews.
2. **Apply IHRA Definition:** Antisemitism involves targeting Jews through stereotypes or generalizations.
3. **Analyze the Statement:** The tweet uses a stereotype (loyalty to a political party linked to disloyalty towards a ethnic group), fitting the IHRA criteria for antisemitism.

Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet's content does not explicitly link Jews to disloyalty for voting for Democrats. Instead, it reflects a criticism directed at Jewish leaders in Trump's statement about loyalty. While the tweet may imply a stereotype by associating vote choice with loyalty traits tied to Jewish identity, it is presented as a critique of political behavior rather than overt antisemitic rhetoric targeting the entire Jewish community. Without explicit discrimination or generalization against all Jews based on their voting choice, it does not meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It does not express any form of hatred, demonization, or discrimination towards Jews. According to the IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves expressions of hatred, stereotypes, or discrimination directed toward Jews. Since this tweet merely reports on a protest without any negative connotations towards Jewish individuals or communities, it does not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. It involves a protest by Jews in NYC against Ilhan Omar, focusing on her political stance rather than targeting Jews as a group. There are no negative stereotypes or discrimination based on Jewish identity, and it aligns with principles of respecting others' rights and opposing antisemitism through legitimate means."

That he was a Jew is undeniable.,No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. It makes a categorical statement about Jesus's Jewishness without engaging in hatred, discrimination, or promotion of negative stereotypes directed at Jews. While it could be subject to misinterpretation related to Jewish identity, it does not directly target Jews or express any form of hostile intent.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet references Pilate asking Jesus if he was the King of the Jews, which is a historical and religious context. There is no overt discrimination or stereotype about Jews being identified as royalty. Instead, it refers to a religious figure's title within a broader historical and religious discussion. The JDA defines antisemitism as directed at Jews specifically, either in words, images, or deeds, but this tweet does not engage in any such actions or stereotypes. It is more of a reference to history without promoting any harmful views about the Jewish community.

Thus, while it mentions Jews, it doesn't use any context that would align with the JDA's guidelines for antisemitism."

Therefore, according to the IHRA's definition, the tweet does not constitute antisemitism.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It makes a stereotypical claim that Democrats are an ""Anti-Jewish Party,"" which aligns with the JDA's guidelines. Such labeling is a form of essentializing, treating a group based on their ethnicity rather than individual characteristics or actions. Additionally, the tweet dismisses the existence of a non-existent ""Jexodus movement,"" reinforcing negative stereotypes and stigmatization without evidence. The use of this term contributes to harmful generalizations that do not respect individuals' identities or contributions.

The tweet's claims are based on statistics about the number of Jewish Democrats in Congress but uses them to create a broad, stereotypical label. This is problematic because it oversimplifies complex political groups and can perpetuate prejudice against Jews by reducing their involvement to ethnicity rather than individual merit or context. While the claim could be seen as a form of discrimination, the tweet does not explicitly group Jews together in an inherently negative way beyond labeling a party ""Anti-Jewish.""

These actions align with the criteria of targeting Jewish individuals or groups based on their identity.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits multiple instances of antisemitic behavior as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Essentializing and Generalization**: Paul Nehlen's comment about hating Blacks, Jews, and non-whites is a form of essentialization. He treats entire groups based on ethnicity rather than individuals, which aligns with JDA guideline 1.

2. **Symbolic Reference to Antisemitism**: By referencing the Tree of Life Synagogue, a known symbol often associated with anti-Semitic stereotypes, he ties his actions and beliefs to a negative stereotype about Jews, as per JDA point 2.

3. **Hostility and Prejudice**: His promotion of a ""race war"" and association with Nazis further escalates antisemitism by promoting racial violence against Jewish communities, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and discriminatory behavior.

Each component of his tweet directly addresses aspects of antisemitism outlined in the JDA, making his message clearly antisemitic."

According to guideline 2, antisemitism involves linking Jews to evil forces and using negative stereotypes or language. The tweet's use of derogatory terms falls under this definition, fitting within the JDA framework. While the context relates to Zionists at a pro-Palestine rally, the language directly targets Jews, aligning with antisemitic behavior defined in the guidelines."

The tweet also employs conspiracy theories and comparison to historical extremist groups, further reinforcing antisemitism by targeting Jews collectively rather than addressing individual actions or providing factual basis.",Yes,"The tweet incorporates elements that align with antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration. It uses the term ""exterminate"" in the context of plotting against three groups, including Jews, which can be interpreted as projecting harmful stereotypes and discrimination against them. While the tweet's main focus is on Trump supporters being domestic terrorists without explicitly targeting Jews beyond a general statement about plotting to erase them among others, it stretches the definition by implying a broader antisemitic narrative.

People who freed slaves were criminalized. People who stood up for equality &amp; justice were vilified and criminalized. \n\nLegality is not a guide for morality!,Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by breaking down the tweet and then applying the IHRA criteria.

The tweet says:

""The Holocaust was legal. Slavery was legal. Segregation was legal.\n\nPeople who hid Jews in their homes were criminalized. People who freed slaves were criminalized. People who stood up for equality & justice were vilified and criminalized. \n\nLegality is not a guide for morality!""

First, the tweet makes claims about the legality of historical events: Holocaust, slavery, segregation. I know that these were all illegal in many parts of history, but the tweet seems to present them as if they were legal.

Then it talks about people who hid Jews being criminalized, which is accurate because hiding Jews was a crime under Nazi laws. Similarly, freeing slaves was also illegal and led to legal consequences.

The tweet then goes on to criticize those who stood up for equality and justice by calling them vilified and criminalized. This is where I have to be careful. The IHRA definition mentions that antisemitism includes targeting the state of Israel or using symbols associated with classic antisemitism, like claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel.

In this tweet, the person is equating support for equality and justice with being a criminalizer of these historical wrongs. They're suggesting that people who supported equality are the same kind of criminals as those who supported the Nazi regime in the past. This uses a double standard by singling out Jews for their alignment with certain moral positions.

Looking at the IHRA definition, it includes using sinister stereotypes and negative character traits towards Jews or institutions associated with them. The tweet seems to lump together a broad range of people (those supporting equality) with specific historical villains without distinguishing between them based on race or religion. This could be seen as a stereotype that justifies the criminalization of groups of people, which aligns with antisemitic rhetoric.

Also, the tweet's message is that ""legality"" isn't a guide for morality, implying that what was legal in the past (like slavery and segregation) shouldn't inform modern morality. This could be interpreted as denying the gravity of historical atrocities and using them to invalidate current moral standards, which is another form of antisemitism by applying such justifications specifically towards Jews.

So putting it all together: The tweet uses historical facts about Jews being criminalized for their actions (like hiding them) but then falsely equates this with those who support equality today. It employs a double standard and negative characterization that could be seen as perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it employs a double standard by equating the actions of people who hid Jews (criminalized) with those advocating for equality, thereby vilifying them without distinguishing based on race or religion. It uses historical context to justify moral relativism, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes and rhetoric that targets Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly denies the legality of the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation, which are well-known historical atrocities. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), denying the Holocaust by claiming it was legal is considered antisemitic ( guideline 5). Additionally, the tweet associates hiding Jews with criminalization while freeing slaves or advocating for equality with negative consequences, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes."

It employs harmful stereotypes, such as blaming specific groups like white evangelicals for the actions against Jews. This aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, which includes making negative remarks about Jews or their communities and using rhetoric that dehumanizes them.

The tweet's content falsely associates American Jews with Trump, neo-Nazis, and violence, which are typical of antisemitic tropes. It also directs criticism towards white evangelicals, suggesting they should stop speaking out in support of Jewish causes. This is an example of antisemitism because it perpetuates stereotypes and targets a specific group for perceived negative behavior related to Jewish peoplehood.

Additionally, the tweet's language and claims about Jews being responsible for historical atrocities (like the Holocaust) without proper context or denial fits within IHRA's definition as it associates Jews with harmful ideologies. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet begins by acknowledging American Jews as a reliable Democratic voter bloc and expresses dislike towards Trump, characterizing him as an ""antисemitic threat."" While this could be interpreted as aligning with antisemitic stereotypes about Jews, the tweet's primary focus is on criticizing white evangelicals for perceived anti-Semitism. By targeting these individuals specifically, the speaker may be projecting their own biases rather than addressing the actions of anti-Semitic figures like Trump directly.

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination against Jews based on their Jewishness or institutions. However, in this case, the tweet shifts the blame to white evangelicals for what it perceives as anti-Semitism, which can contribute to stigmatizing non-Jewish groups and does not directly address antisemitic behavior towards Jews themselves. Therefore, while some elements may align with antisemitic themes, the overall approach targets a non-Jewish group, making the tweet not strictly antisemitic according to the JDA's definition."

By referencing this term without context or nuance, the tweet risks perpetuating harmful stereotypes about Jews by associating them with atrocities committed during Nazi rule.

While it excludes Jews from the nativity scene, there is no overt hatred or demonization toward them. The exclusion serves a cultural purpose without targeting Jewish people specifically for hatred or stereotyping. It can be viewed as a form of satire rather than antisemitic content.

The tweet's primary intent appears to be celebrating diversity by removing one specific group (Jews) from the scene, which does not align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving hostility or exclusion based on Jewish heritage.",No,"The tweet in question is ""A nativity scene without Jews, Arabs, Africans or refugees."" According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. While the tweet excludes certain groups from a nativity scene, it does not explicitly target Jews with any negative description or generalization about their identity. Instead, it appears to be part of a broader discussion on diversity and inclusivity in media representation.

The exclusion of specific groups like Jews, Arabs, Africans, or refugees might be interpreted as challenging stereotypes or promoting diversity but is not inherently antisemitic since there is no hostile or discriminatory treatment directed at Jews themselves. The tweet's focus is on removing these groups from a traditional setting rather than profiling or essentializing Jews.

It involves making broad generalizations about the views of the British Jewish community based on a survey conducted on an extremely small and likely non-representative sample (0.28%).

The action of using such a small group to extrapolate widely may contribute to antisemitism by stigmatizing a community and spreading potentially harmful perceptions.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) to perpetuate antisemitic themes. The argument presented is based on a survey conducted among only 0.28% of the British Jewish community, which is an extremely small sample size relative to the entire community. This small group's responses are then used to make broad generalizations about the entire British Jewish population, effectively essentializing their views.

Such an approach aligns with guideline A1 of the JDA, which prohibits treating a character trait as inherent without sufficient evidence—essentially stereotyping. By extrapolating from such a tiny sample, the tweet risks reinforcing negative stereotypes and reducing the community to their opinions or characteristics based on limited data.

Additionally, under guideline B7, the tweet associates Corbyn's potential leadership with issues related to Jewish collective responsibility or agency, albeit indirectly. This raises concerns about generalizing community actions without specific evidence, thereby contributing to antisemitic narratives by oversimplifying complex political and social dynamics.

In summary, the tweet uses a small sample size to make broad statements that essentialize the British Jewish community's views, aligning with the JDA's criteria for antisemitism. This form of stereotyping and generalization is harmful and discriminative."

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements:** The tweet uses ""Jews"" to imply they steal from Black people and mentions God's role in primacy.
2. **Negative Stereotypes:** The association of Jews with theft against Black people fits the stereotyping aspect.
3. **Conspiracy Theory:** Suggesting Jews are responsible for such theft aligns with the use of conspiracy theories.
4. **Targeted Language:** Using ""Jews"" specifically targets this group, avoiding generalization.

Wait, but according to the user's analysis, the tweet targets specific groups and uses incorrect associations. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Context:** The tweet is directed at Dr. Ron Malka (@DrRonMalka) and another entity referred to as @isro, using the pronoun ""you"" in a grammatically incorrect manner (""You jews..."") which might be an error or intentional.

2. **Analyzing the Content:** The tweet makes derogatory remarks about Jews by questioning their effectiveness and dismissing them with a critical tone. It uses language that could perpetuate stereotypes or negative character traits towards Jewish individuals or groups.

3. **Applying IHRA Definition:**
   - **Perception of Hate (Definition Point 1):** The tweet expresses a perception of Jews as ineffective or dismissible, aligning with the notion of hatred toward Jews.
   - **Stereotyping and Negative Traits:** The critical remarks could be interpreted as using negative character traits associated with antisemitism.

4. **Conclusion:** Given the critical tone towards an entire group without specific targeting but implied through references to Dr. Malka and @isro, it fits within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism by expressing a negative perception or attitude towards Jews.",No,"The tweet uses a derogatory term ""jews"" without providing any context or justification, which constitutes antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

3. **Guideline Compliance**: This aligns with guidelines 3 (use of harmful words or deeds), 9 ( attribution of loyalty based on ethnicity), and the broader concept of essentializing a population as outlined in guideline 1.

Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let me start by reading the tweet carefully.

The tweet says: ""The Holocaust was legal. Slavery was legal. Segregation was legal.\n\nPeople who hid Jews in their homes were criminalized. People who freed slaves were criminalized. People who stood up for equality & justice were vilified and criminalized.\n\nLegality is not a guide for morality!""

First, I'll break it down into parts to understand the arguments made.

1. The user claims that historical events like the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation were legal.
2. They argue that those who hid Jews (which could be seen as helping Jews), freed slaves, or stood up for equality were criminalized and vilified.
3. Finally, they dismiss the idea that legality is a guide for morality.

Now, according to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews based on their Jewishness. It also includes using symbols, images, or stereotypes associated with antisemitic traditions against Jewish people or institutions.

Looking at each part:

1. The statements about the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation being ""legal"" are problematic because they downplay or deny historical facts. For instance, the Holocaust was a genocide, not just legal but a crime against humanity. Similarly, segregation is widely recognized as illegal in many places now.
   
2. The user associates acts of kindness towards Jews (hiding them, freeing slaves) with criminality. This could be seen as implying that helping Jews is wrong or bad, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes where aiding Jews is equated with evil.

3. The argument that legal standards shouldn't dictate morality is a bit vague here but might not directly relate to antisemitism unless it's used to justify treating Jews differently based on such principles.

In the guidelines, point 10 states that denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish as Jews is antisemitic. The tweet seems to imply that helping Jews (by freeing slaves or hiding them) was wrong, which could be interpreted as denying their right or existence.

Also, under guideline 2, antisemitism often involves linking a group to forces of evil. Here, the user associates acts of kindness towards Jews with being criminals, which is a form of projecting negative stereotypes about Jews linked to positive traits (kindness), thus reinforcing antisemitic views.

Point 14 in the guidelines mentions that political speech doesn't have to be tempered to be protected under human rights laws. However, this doesn't directly address the content's antisemitism but rather its treatment under law.

Therefore, considering all these points, the tweet uses historical inaccuracies and ties acts of kindness towards Jews with criminality, which aligns with antisemitic themes.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines. It downplays or denies the severity of historical atrocities such as the Holocaust and slavery while equating acts of kindness toward Jews (like hiding them) with criminality. This approach reinforces negative stereotypes and links Jewish people with harmful traits, aligning with antisemitic definitions that involve discrimination based on Jewish identity and the use of antisemitic symbols or stereotypes."

Arrests imminent #JewsAgainstICE https://t.co/PtQNvZnz0R,No,"The tweet describes an action involving ""Jews blocking entrance to Elizabeth Concentration Camp in New Jersey"" with the intention of arresting them. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred toward Jews expressed through speech, writing, visual forms, and actions using negative stereotypes or blame. This tweet merely reports an event without any overtly hostile language or context suggesting broader hatred or blame towards Jews as a group. It does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic.

The use of ""Jews"" as a noun refers to people with a specific identity but lacks the stigmatizing or context that would classify it as antisemitism. There's no mention of conspiracy theories, denial of historical events, or application of double standards characteristic of antisemitic rhetoric. Therefore, while ""Jews"" is used, the tweet does not align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism because it doesn't involve hatred or blame toward Jews in a context that would justify categorization under that definition.

Answer: No

The tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It simply reports an event involving blocking access at the Elizabeth Concentration Camp, without any overtly hostile language or context suggesting broader hatred or blame towards Jews as a group.",Yes,"The tweet employs historical associations to target Jews by linking them with ICE, which has roots in the deportation of Jewish individuals during the Holocaust. This association uses stereotypes and symbols (as per JDA guidelines 6) to incite antisemitism, fitting the definition of discrimination against a specific group based on their identity without providing factual basis for such an association.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Identify the Core Issue:** The tweet associates Jews with ICE actions, drawing historical parallels.
2. **Apply JDA Guidelines:** This ties into guidelines 6 (applying symbols) and 5 (using historical context to incite hatred).
3. **Assess Directness of Targeting:** Specifically mentions ""Jews"" without substantial justification, fitting antisemitic patterns.
4. **Conclusion:** The tweet uses stereotyping and historical associations to promote a form of antisemitism.

Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA."

It is a general statement about Jews being sociable without any overtly hateful language, discriminatory intent, or reference to Israel as a collectivity. There are no elements of antisemitism such as hate speech, stereotyping, or criticism directed at Jewish individuals or communities.",No,"The tweet ""@1littleBIGMOUTH Jews are a sociable bunch"" does not appear to be antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It makes a positive statement about Jews' sociability without suggesting any inherent evil or negative traits. Essentializing a group into stereotypes, even if positive, can be problematic only if it oversimplifies their complexities or ties them to antagonist qualities beyond behavior. Here, the content is neutral and does not imply any negative stereotypes related to race or ethnicity.

DECISION: No"
1204841860600078337,SmileDarling2,2019-12-11 19:14:19+00:00,0,Jews,"He's trying to demoralise, not just Jews such as myself but all of our many well-wishers at the expense of the Left for the pettiest of political advantages given he's a LibDem. Whichever percent votes Labour will not contain the most antisemitic elements of the population.",Yes,"The tweet employs a form of stereotyping by associating individuals from the Labour party with antisemitism, thereby targeting them indirectly through their party affiliation. This could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and aligns with IHRA's definition of accusing a group (Jews) collectively of negative traits or actions, even if not explicitly stated. The tweet risks promoting a prejudice against Jews by suggesting that Labour contains antisemitic elements, thus contributing to antisemitism in the public sphere.",Yes,"The tweet employs several elements that violate the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It essentializes individuals by associating them with 'antisemitic elements' solely based on their voting behavior and political alignment ( guideline 1A). Additionally, it frames political causes as tools to identify and stigmatize Jews, thereby linking political support to inherent negative characteristics (guideline 2B). This broad generalization without targeting specific individuals or providing evidence of antisemitism aligns with the JDA's criteria for antisemitic behavior. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

More importantly: you're a huge danger to Jews around the world with your vindictive game-playing with these accusations of anti-Semitism to win elections. Few people are doing more to trivialize anti-Semitism than those like you: it's not your toy.,Yes,"The tweet appears to engage in antisemitic language and ideas according to the IHRA's definition. It uses terms that trivialize anti-Semitism, such as ""trivializing,"" which implies reducing it to something simplistic. Additionally, it suggests that Tom Hanks is using accusations of anti-Semitism against Jews to protect himself, potentially implying a conspiracy or negative stereotype about Jews. While Tom Hanks' public advocacy for Israel might mitigate the antisemitic connotation in some contexts, the tweet's language and framing align with antisemitic behavior by perpetuating harmful stereotypes.",No,"The tweet does not contain content that violates the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines. 

The analysis reveals that while certain parts may appear to comment on issues related to anti-Semitism, they do not explicitly or antisemitically manifest as defined by the JDA. Specifically:
1. ""You're a huge danger to Jews around the world..."" suggests targeting Jews with harmful intent but does not imply malice without context.
2. ""vindictive game-playing"" refers to behavior without clear evidence of antisemitism.
3. ""trivializing anti-Semitism"" uses sarcasm rather than a direct attack, and the comparison to ""your toy"" is self-critical rather than against Jews.

The tweet does not consistently apply JDA standards for discrimination, prejudice, or incitement, thus it is not considered antisemitic."
