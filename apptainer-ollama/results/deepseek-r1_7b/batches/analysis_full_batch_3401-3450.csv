However, while the user critiques this viewpoint, they do not engage in discriminatory behavior as defined by the JDA. The use of terms like ""Jews are the root"" aligns with antisemitic views (guideline 7), but since the tweet does not explicitly promote or propagate such ideas and instead suggests educational efforts, it is not itself antisemitic.

Liberals? Remember that awful Stallone movie?,Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it employs stereotyping by labeling and broadly generalizing about Jewish communities. It suggests that police unions are unjustly targeting people of color (POC) and implies that Jews will be next in line, using a metaphor (the Stallone movie) often associated with negative portrayals of Jews. This aligns with IHRA's definition as it involves directing negative expressions toward Jews, whether explicitly or by implication, and uses harmful metaphors to justify discrimination against them.",Yes,"The tweet employs several elements from the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses a stereotype or negative stereotype of Police Organizations and humanizes them to blame marginalized groups like Jews. The use of coded language equating police actions against POC with actions against Jews aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly regarding making broad generalizations about populations and using symbols to stigmatize. Additionally, the tweet refers to Jews in a derogatory manner as part of a pattern it suggests could be applied to them, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes. These factors collectively classify the tweet as antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

While it contains several anti-political statements directed at the Republican party and candidate Biden, none of these statements specifically target or perpetuate antisemitism based on Jewish identity. Antisemitism under IHRA requires a clear perception of hatred towards Jews, which is not present here as the tweet does not reference Jews by name or use any negative stereotypes or characteristics unique to their group. Instead, it focuses on political criticism and general accusations without engaging with specific aspects related to Jewish identity.",Yes,"The tweet includes the phrase ""JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US,"" which explicitly targets Jews as a group without providing evidence or context suggesting they are hostile. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines, particularly point 7, where Jews can be collectively misrepresented or blamed for a state's actions. The use of ""JEWS"" to imply potential subjugation or negative intent towards the Jewish people is a direct form of antisemitism."

While the mention of Hitler's manifesto predates American influence in Europe could be seen as an attempt to associate anti-Semitic actions with a perceived threat from outside Europe, this approach is inconsistent with antisemitism. The tweet does not explicitly accuse Jews or promote harmful stereotypes about their actions but rather associates them with a historical period and event through the lens of cultural bias, which could be considered a form of indirect antisemitism by perpetuating outdated narratives.",No,"The tweet does not directly address or endorse any of the JDA's explicit guidelines on antisemitism, such as denying Israel's responsibility for historical atrocities (point 10) or applying stereotypes to individuals based on race (points 2 and 6). However, the mention of the Vichy regime possibly turning over Jews because they watched American films could be misinterpreted as implying a prejudice against Jews based on external factors like film consumption. This conveys a form of stereotyping without explicitly stating it, which aligns with JDA's definition by associating a group (Jews) with negative outcomes through external causes, thereby potentially contributing to antisemitism.

The tweet does not explicitly use the JDA's examples but could be seen as invoking harmful stereotypes if misread. Therefore, while it doesn't directly contradict the guidelines, its content might still touch upon antisemitic themes by suggesting a link between Jewish identity and historical events through external influences."

It makes general statements about Zionism and anti-Semitism without targeting specific individuals, groups, or institutions. While it may touch on harmful stereotypes when considered in context, it is not explicitly discriminatory against Jewish people or communities based on the provided criteria.",No,"The tweet does not qualify as antisemitic according to the JDA. While it makes some points about opposition to Israel and does not essentialize all Jews, the use of broad generalizations (e.g., ""many Jews are not Zionists,"" ""most Zionists are not Jews"") risks reinforcing stereotypes that could be seen as problematic under JDA guidelines. However, since the tweet aligns with B13 by focusing on criticism based on principles rather than group essentialization, it is not strictly anti-Semitic.

Wait, but according to the detailed analysis above, while part of the reasoning leans towards no due to some points supporting non-antisemitic criticism, the key issue is that making broad generalizations about groups can lead to antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet does cross into being antisemitic by essentializing certain groups and reinforcing negative stereotypes.

This use of a harmful stereotype contributes to antisemitism under IHRA's definition, as it perpetuates negative perceptions and associations about Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits several hallmarks of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration. It essentializes Jews by singularizing them with fascists and using broad generalizations (""Jews who continue to align themselves with fascists""), which disregards individual variation (guideline 1).

There is no discrimination or hatred directed specifically at Jews beyond what is already part of historical context. The wording remains respectful and factual, avoiding any form of antisemitic rhetoric or stereotypes.

The IHRA definition focuses on a negative perception of Jews, which this tweet does not engage in. Instead, it provides a remembrance of all victims without targeting any specific group beyond the Holocaust's impact. Therefore, according to the IHRA working definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic because it does not exhibit any form of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence directed specifically at Jews. It acknowledges the Holocaust's victims in a factual manner without implying any negative stereotypes, bias, or discrimination against Jews beyond their representation as victims.

The tweet correctly includes mention of other victim groups alongside Jews, avoiding any context that could be interpreted as anti-Semitic. Thus, it aligns with JDA's guidelines on antisemitism."

It is critical of Andrew Yang's analogy but does not engage in or express hatred or discrimination directed toward Jews. Instead, it critiques political behavior and uses controversial language without targeting Jewish individuals or communities negatively.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as expressions of hatred or negative perception toward Jews, including through speech, writing, actions, etc. The tweet in question does not exhibit any such traits; instead, it is a critique of political arguments. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA's definition.

The tweet's primary focus is on political opposition rather than any form of discrimination or hatred directed at Jewish people. It does not align with the examples provided by IHRA regarding antisemitism, which involve explicit or indirect targeting of Jews through various forms of expression and behavior.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the JDA definition. Andrew Yang frames BDS supporters as ""violent fascists,"" which could be misleading, as BDS is a human rights movement advocating for equality and dignity for Palestinians. While he critiques their association with Palestinian nationalism, he doesn't explicitly target Jews or use antisemitic language that equates BDS with denying Jewish existence.

Israel's denied white reformed jews to do aliyah before and i doubt they'd change the rules for a ugandan community,Yes,"The tweet implies unfair treatment of one Jewish group (white reformists) and suggests similar rules for another (Ugandan community), which could be seen as discriminatory based on Jewish identity. This aligns with antisemitic criteria of targeting specific groups without a legitimate basis, thus qualifying the tweet as antisemitic according to the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet discusses the criteria for identifying Jews and suggests that Israel treats different communities differently based on these criteria. However, according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as a group. While the tweet touches on themes related to strict identity criteria, it does not explicitly discriminate against specific individuals or groups of Jews in a way that aligns with JDA's definition. The statement is more about policy judgments rather than personal discrimination or promoting harmful stereotypes about Jewish people."
