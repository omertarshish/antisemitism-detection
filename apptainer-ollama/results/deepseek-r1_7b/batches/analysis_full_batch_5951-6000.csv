It attacks the notion of strategic alliances with Jews by highlighting their extensive political influence and resources, suggesting they don't need assistance. This aligns with JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination or hostility against Jews, particularly through symbolic imagery and association with powerful entities linked to others' interests. Additionally, it denies their legitimate rights without acknowledging their contributions, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes.

The user using the handle ""vosterzion"" is known for promoting anti-Semitic ideologies through his username and online presence, often using Yiddish slurs against Jews. However, the tweet itself does not directly reference Jews in a negative manner but rather uses a reaction emoji to a tweet from vosterzion, which could be misinterpreted as promoting antisemitism if taken out of context. Yet, since the user's behavior is recognized for antisemitism, sharing his tweets can perpetuate such ideologies indirectly.

Wait, upon reconsideration: The original tweet contains an image with Hebrew text that translates to something positive about Muslims and Jews living together harmoniously. However, the username ""vosterzion"" is associated with anti-Semitic content. Therefore, the tweet itself does not contain any antisemitic elements, but sharing it could be seen as promoting a harmful viewpoint if taken out of context.

But since the user is known for antisemitism, sharing their tweets can indirectly perpetuate such ideologies. However, the tweet in question is neutral and positive, so it doesn't directly engage with Jews negatively.

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses a positive framing of ""muslims and Jews living together in harmony,"" avoiding the use of negative or pejorative language typical of antisemitic content.

The tweet does not employ any of the specific examples outlined as antisemitic, such as denying Jewish rights or using negative stereotypes about Jews towards Israel.

However, without specific evidence to support these claims and by focusing on a cultural adaptation rather than direct harm, the tweet does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet presents several elements that align with antisemitic themes from the JDA. It uses terms like ""toybox"" and suggests that Jews have been used by Christians as a cultural resource, implying a lack of seriousness or respect. Additionally, it claims that many Jews died at Christian hands to preserve traditions, which involves violence against Jews. While the adaptation of Jewish holidays is noted positively, the negative framing and violent implication undermine this. Therefore, according to the JDA's guidelines, the tweet exhibits antisemitism by promoting stereotypes and implying violent targeting of Jews by Christians."

It criticizes Israel's actions in a general context without directly addressing or unfairly singling out Jewish communities with any of IHRA’s defined forms of antisemitism.

The tweet does not mention or imply any antisemitic slurs, stereotypes, or discrimination regarding Jews or the State of Israel. Instead, it seems to focus on criticism of government actions related to bio weapons and vaccine distribution without targeting specific groups based on their Jewish heritage. The critique is more general and does not align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.

Therefore, this tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA's working definition.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitic content according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It uses several criteria from section B of the JDA, particularly points 7 and 8. The tweet holds Jews responsible for actions against Israel, such as releasing bioweapons and having a cure ready, while suggesting that Jews should receive priority in pandemic relief without addressing their own complicity or equality issues. Additionally, it employs stereotypes like referring to Jews as using ""mafia-like tactics,"" which is a common antisemitic stereotype tied to point 2 of the guidelines. These elements together align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, indicating antisemitic intent in its content and context."

The tweet uses derogatory language (""King of Jews"") directed at Donald Trump, a public figure who is also a Jewish person (as his father is Ashkenazi Jewish). By calling him ""King of Jews,"" it employs a stereotypical label that attacks a protected group. Additionally, changing his title to ""King of World"" broadens the scope but still associates him with Jewish characteristics, potentially perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes. The tweet's language could be interpreted as incitement or support for hatred towards Jewish people, aligning with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves negative characterization and potential stigmatization of a protected group.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses the term ""Jews"" to refer to Donald Trump, labeling him as ""King of Jews."" According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes essentializing individuals by associating them with a specific ethnicity or stereotype. This label reduces Trump to his Jewish heritage without context, effectively treating him as part of a negative stereotype. While the tweet does not explicitly link Trump's actions to evil but uses a term that categorizes him based on ethnicity, this approach aligns with JDA guidelines that prohibit essentializing and reducing individuals to their ethnic identity inappropriately. Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic under the given definition."

It equates Serbian anti-Semitism with Croatian subversion, suggesting a negative stereotype about Jews (a group-based stereotype). The statement that ""Jews have great potential for both good and evil"" perpetuates harmful generalizations often criticized by the IHRA as contributing to antisemitism. Additionally, advising against hatred towards Serbian Jews aligns with denying their humanity or rights, which is anti-Semitic. While the tweet doesn't directly target Jews but uses language that reflects negative perceptions of a group based on others' actions, it still falls under the IHRA's definition of antisemitism due to its broad generalizations and encouragement of hatred against Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet engages in several aspects outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). First, it uses the term ""Serbian anti-Semitism,"" which is a broad generalization that oversimplifies and essentializes a group of people. This aligns with JDA's guideline 1, where essentializing populations is considered racist. Additionally, the tweet associates Serbian Jews with ""Croatian subversion and deception,"" projecting negative stereotypes without evidence, which fits into JDA's framework of linking Jews to evil traits (guideline 2). The statement about Jews having potential for both good and evil also reflects common antisemitic tropes ( guideline 4), where positive attributes are attributed based on circumstances rather than inherent qualities. Overall, the tweet employs stereotyping and broad generalizations that constitute antisemitism according to the JDA definition."

If someone has to dramatically change their way of life to follow that simple request, then maybe their culture needs improving anyway.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA definition. While it uses broad language that could be interpreted as critical of non-Jews, it does not specifically target or denominate Jews by name. Furthermore, it presents a stereotypical and generalized critique without addressing specific instances of antisemitic behavior. The tweet's content does not fit the pattern of directing harmful remarks towards Jewish individuals or entities based on the definition provided.

The tweet suggests that Israel only asks non-Jews not to commit violence but frames this as a reason for cultural improvement, which is more aligned with anti-Semitic stereotypes than an antisemitic one. However, without explicit targeting or denial of the Holocaust, it does not fully meet the IHRA's standards for antisemitism.

The tweet may inadvertently perpetuate harmful stereotypes but does not consistently apply the elements outlined in the IHRA definition, such as overt hatred, physical or verbal manifestations directed specifically at Jewish individuals or institutions. Therefore, it is not classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA's working definition.",No,"The tweet in question does not directly use antisemitic language but makes a statement about Israel's perceived requests of non-Jews. The phrase ""If someone has to dramatically change their way of life to follow that simple request"" could imply cultural control or deficiency, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes by suggesting that non-Jews' cultures need improvement as a result of imposed demands. This interpretation ties into the JDA's guidelines, particularly regarding cultural adaptation and implicit hostile language towards non-Jewish groups due to perceived domination."

While it does not directly express hatred towards specific Jewish individuals, the association suggests support for antisemitic actions.

This kind of imagery can be linked to anti-Semitic ideologies, particularly those suggesting a negative stereotype about Jews. While it doesn't explicitly target Israel or invoke historical context, the metaphor still constitutes antisemitism by employing discriminatory language and ideas."

However, it implies a stereotype where Jews are equated with problematic behavior, which could contribute to antisemitism by invoking negative stereotypes or biases against Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet from NYC Mayor-elect Eric Adams exhibits antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It Essentializes Jews by suggesting they are problematic and require police intervention in the name of ""defending"" them.

I love Hercegovce btw, just so there is no confusion.",Yes,"The tweet employs language that equates the hatred directed towards Hercegovac with that towards Jews. By stating ""In Croatia Hercegovac is more hated than a Jew"" and expressing negative feelings about Hercegovac while also mentioning loving it, the tweet uses a negative stereotype to target Jews. This aligns with antisemitic themes of discrimination based on ethnicity.",No,"The tweet refers to ""Hercegovac"" as a place and uses ""Jew"" to denote someone from that town without targeting all Jews. It clarifies that they love Hercegovac, avoiding antisemitic generalization. Therefore, it doesn't meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

---

**Final Answer:**

DECISION: No  
The tweet does not constitute antisemitism as it refers to a specific place (""Hercegovac"") and uses ""Jew"" in a clarifying manner without targeting all Jews."

Additionally, while the tweet also includes a statement about harmony among Moslems, Christians, and Jews in Asia Minor, this does not negate or justify the persecution part directed at Jews. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, the tweet is antisemitic as it perpetuates negative perceptions of Jews based on their Jewish identity without providing any positive context that mitigates such treatment.",No,"The tweet in question makes a historical critique of Jewish persecution in Europe and does not explicitly target Israel or its policies, thus avoiding direct reference to antisemitism under the JDA's guidelines. While the language used could imply broader criticisms, it is framed within factual statements rather than coded references specifically targeting Israel. Therefore, according to the JDA, this tweet is not considered antisemitic as it does not meet any of the outlined criteria for antisemitism in this context."

It employs hostile language targeting Jews, suggesting they pay lip service to patriotism when fighting what it perceives as enemies (Jews), thereby implying a lack of sincerity and shifting their focus to negative behaviors like porn. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, including use of negative stereotypes and associating Jews with undesirable actions beyond criticism of Israel.",Yes,"The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition. It employs critical language against actions involving Jews, such as attacking national resilience among ""whites"" if fighting enemies of Jews, which aligns with the idea that Jews might be agents of negative outcomes (point 7). Additionally, it uses coded references like ""the act of sex"" and ""porn,"" which could imply a problematic association between certain behaviors and Jewish people. While not explicitly denying evil traits associated with Jews, the tweet's tone and content fit within the antisemitic framework by targeting specific actions linked to Jewish individuals without acknowledging their humanity or intent."

While this could be seen as contributing to anti-Semitism by associating Jews with negative stereotypes, it doesn't explicitly align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism through coded language or symbols directed at Jews.

While the term ""Palestinian"" might initially seem neutral, the tweet explicitly accuses these schools of promoting anti-Semitic ideologies and advocating for the murder of Jews. This direct targeting aligns with antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which includes both direct and indirect attacks against Jews. The tweet's association of funding these schools with Palestinian groups could be interpreted as part of a broader antisemitic narrative, making it problematic under IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs antisemitic content as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet suggests that funding schools in Palestine, which teach jihad and advocate for the murder of Jews, is a justified use of UK taxpayer money. This aligns with guideline 2, where the JDA identifies linking Jews to evil as a core antisemitic idea. The tweet associates Jewish people with harmful ideologies, projecting a negative stereotype on them through the support for Palestinian educational initiatives that promote hatred and violence. Therefore, it constitutes antisemitism by essentializing and stereotyping Jews based on their association with violent and prejudiced content."

Additionally, it references historical atrocities against Jews in Antwerp and broadly associates Belgium with racism towards Jews, aligning with harmful stereotypes that characterize antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target individual Jews and lacks specific instances of antisemitic behavior such as discriminatory remarks or references to historical atrocities against particular groups. While it contains strong language and general statements about Jewish people in Belgium, it is more broadly critical of Belgium's history without addressing antisemitism directly.

This use of stereotypes and stereotyping constitutes an antisemitic act as it directs harm based on group identity.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA definition. Here's why:

1. **Essentialization and Generalization:** The tweet refers to ""Jews who are victims of Antisemitism"" without specific context, which could be seen as essentializing a group rather than addressing specific incidents.

2. **Targeted Language:** While the tweet mocks young Jews, it doesn't explicitly use symbols or stereotypes (like swastikas) and doesn't link them to broader antisemitic ideas like being agents of another force.

3. **Contextual Accuracy:** The mention of Erev Chag adds context that such targeting is part of Jewish traditions, which aligns with just cause for criticism rather than general attack.

4. **Lack of Hidden Agenda:** There's no coded language suggesting manipulation or hidden evil intent towards an entire group without justification.

The IHRA definition of antisemitism involves hatred, discrimination, or conspiracy theories directed specifically at Jews, which this tweet does not exhibit. Instead, it appears to be making a playful comment without targeting any group negatively.

The tweet uses ""Jews"" in a neutral manner, focusing on Fauci's name and the Oxford comma rather than associating them with any negative stereotypes or conspiracies related to antisemitism. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet uses ""Jews"" in the context of associating Fauci with a negative stereotype but does not exhibit any overt discrimination or prejudice.

It employs humor by referencing ""Purim2020"" and the phrase ""#AmYsraelChai,"" which is a common Israeli expression. While it associates Israel with actions against Jews, this is presented in a satirical context rather than making broad generalizations about all Israelis. The IHRA definition focuses on specific acts of antisemitism involving hate speech or conspiracies, which are not clearly present here.

The tweet's content could be seen as mocking the idea of ""anitisemitism"" (a non-term) and suggesting a vigil against such an imaginary issue, which does not align with any of the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism.

It makes general comments about voting habits and political affiliations based on race, which do not target Jews specifically with hatred or discrimination. There is no overt criticism or rhetoric directed toward Jewish individuals or communities.",No,"The tweet by George Lincoln Rockwell does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews or Jewish institutions. While the tweet mentions ""Jews"" in the context of voting behavior, it does not employ any of the specific tools outlined in the JDA's guidelines for identifying antisemitic content.

Key points from the analysis:
1. **Essentializing Traits**: Rockwell labels Jews as voting for themselves without implying inherent evil, which does not meet the essentialization criterion.
2. **Linking to Evil**: The tweet lacks broad references linking Jews with harmful actions or conspiracy theories.
3. **No Exclusionary Remarks**: There are no coded language, metaphors, or references to exclusionary policies against Jews.
4. **Context of White Division**: The critique focuses on internal divisions among white voters rather than targeting Jewish individuals or institutions.

Since Rockwell's message pertains to voting behavior and party affiliations without using antisemitic symbols or deploying exclusionary rhetoric, it does not align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

**Answer:**  
DECISION: No  

The tweet does not target specific Jewish individuals or communities and does not involve any overtly antisemitic content such as conspiracy theories about Jews. It merely comments on a shift in public blame towards different actors, referencing China's propaganda tactics without specifically targeting or stereotyping Jewish people. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

**Answer:**  
DECISION: No  

The tweet does not directly address Jewish individuals or perpetuate harmful conspiracy theories about them. It comments on a shift in blame towards different actors and references propaganda tactics without targeting Jews specifically. Thus, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit characteristics of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It involves a shift in blame from Jews to America, drawing an analogy to China's propaganda efforts. This narrative is more about international relations and political strategy rather than direct discrimination, prejudice, or hostilities toward Jewish individuals or communities. The tweet does not reference any anti-Semitic symbols, stereotypes, or historical genocides such as the Holocaust. It focuses on general accusations of actions during a pandemic without targeting Jews specifically, thus aligning more with neutral political commentary rather than antisemitic content."

It focuses on the mayor's actions following incidents targeting Jews but does not exhibit hatred or bias specific to Jewish individuals or groups beyond addressing their concerns.",Yes,"The tweet in question does not explicitly contain any statements that directly attack Jews. However, the mention of arresting ""Jewish mourners"" could imply a targeting of a specific group (Jews) without sufficient justification or proportionality to the situation described. This action might be interpreted as discriminatory behavior against Jews, aligning with guidelines that suggest antisemitism involves harmful actions directed at a specific group based on their identity.

The tweet refers to an increase in attacks on Jews and de Blasio's delayed response, which could be seen as a disproportionate reaction without addressing the root cause of these attacks. While the tweet itself does not contain overtly antisemitic content, the referenced action of arresting Jewish mourners might constitute antisemitism if it reflects discriminatory practices. Without explicit justification or context showing that this arrest was necessitated by the violence against Jews, it raises concerns about targeting a specific group based on their Jewish identity without adequate reason.

This approach targets Jews specifically, using language that implies their negative qualities without basis. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred directed at Jews, either individually or collectively. The tweet's use of a broad label (""Jews"") to imply innocence and ""white people"" to suggest virtue introduces bias and stereotyping. This one-sided comparison perpetuates a harmful perception of Jews as problematic while judging white people positively, aligning with antisemitic practices by singling out a specific group for negative treatment without justification or proportionality.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the JDA.

Additionally, while some might argue that expressing a dislike for all Jews could be addressed through stereotypes, it still violates guidelines against essentializing in the absence of context. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for being antisemitic under the JDA definition."

While such claims can sometimes be part of broader anti-Semitic narratives, this particular statement does not directly align with the JDA's specific guidelines on antisemitism.

According to the JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group, including direct accusations about their flourishing in Israel (guideline 10). However, the tweet does not explicitly deny such flourishing but instead makes an accusation without evidence. It is more of a political statement accusing Soros of selling out Jews rather than directly targeting them for their Jewish identity.

Furthermore, JDA guideline 4 addresses coded speech, which often involves anti-Semitic tropes. While this tweet could be seen as part of that broader context, it does not specifically target Jews as individuals or groups in the manner outlined by the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism (guideline 10). The tweet is more about accusing Soros of a financial misdeed without addressing his Jewish heritage directly.

Additionally, guideline 5 emphasizes the Holocaust denial aspect, but this tweet does not present such a denial. Instead, it accuses Soros of selling out Jews, which could be seen as part of anti-Semitic stereotypes if taken out of context (guideline 14).

In summary, while the tweet contains harmful implications and accusations without evidence, it does not directly meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly because it doesn't explicitly deny or minimize the Holocaust by suggesting that it did not occur."

According to guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews. While the tweet expresses hatred towards both Jews and Arabs, it is not explicitly discriminatory in nature towards Jews alone. It lacks a constructive narrative aimed at changing perceptions of either group but instead perpetuates negative stereotypes without offering an alternative viewpoint.

The JDA's definition focuses on actions that target Jews as a specific group, rather than general statements about hatred directed at people based on their identity. The tweet does not explicitly separate Jews from other groups in its message; it simply accuses both Jews and Arabs of hating the speaker. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

However, if we consider whether the tweet could be interpreted as targeting Jews based on their identity, then under guidelines 2 or 6, which emphasize linking Jews to negative traits or applying stereotypes, it might be seen as indirectly related. But since the tweet does not explicitly associate Jews with hatred in a discriminatory way but rather labels both Jews and Arabs without specific targeting of Jews' characteristics, it does not fully meet the JDA's definition.

While this could imply a negative stereotype about Jewish individuals within these groups, it doesn't explicitly attack individuals or use overtly hateful rhetoric as required by IHRA. The focus is on the organizations rather than individuals perceived as Jewish. Therefore, while there might be an implication of targeting a collective stereotyped as anti-Semitic, it does not meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism which requires explicit attacks against Jews themselves.",Yes,"The tweet targets the State of Israel and the pro-Israel lobby in the US as the main subjects of anti-Zionism. By associating Anti-Zionism with these institutions and questioning their legitimacy, it employs stereotyping (targeting specific groups based on nationality within a country). This aligns with JDA Guidelines 7 and 9, which involve treating Jews as agents of a state or assuming non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel. Thus, the tweet reflects antisemitic behavior by focusing on these groups without considering evidence-based issues."

While BDS often carries negative connotations towards certain groups, the tweet itself does not explicitly target Jews or express any form of antisemitic sentiment, such as hatred toward Jewish individuals, institutions, or properties. It focuses on legislative opposition without engaging with specific Jewish identities or communities. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet supports the BDS movement, which seeks to boycot and oppose Jewish institutions. According to the JDA, this is considered antisemitic as it promotes the idea that Jews are evil or linked to negative forces through supporting opposition to their existence and flourishing. This aligns with guidelines B.10 and A.2, making the tweet antisemitic."

Bernie Sanders, me, and millions of other Jews grew up w/ nearly no extended family in traumatized household because of the Nazis. This comment by Chris Matthews is disgusting. https://t.co/L2ybnPVAiI",No,"The tweet does not conclusively meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. While it contains elements that could be stereotypical (calling someone ""Jew"") and references historical events involving Jews, the tweet is more of a personal critique rather than a generalizable statement about Jews as a group. Therefore, it doesn't sufficiently meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA's definition when perceived neutrally without context.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Jew"" in a derogatory manner, which is a negative stereotype. Additionally, referencing the Holocaust personalizes the tragedy towards a specific Jewish group, perpetuating antisemitic narratives and essentializations."

Pictured is a monument to Yaroslav Stetsko. https://t.co/GZ7lt1gDEn",No,"The tweet in question discusses Yaroslav Stetsko and his actions regarding a militia targeting Jews, accompanied by a monument symbolizing his revolutionary stance against Jews. It does not contain any overtly hateful remarks or use of negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews. Instead, it presents historical facts without promoting hatred towards the Jewish community beyond what is already widely recognized through Stetsko's actions and the broader context of antisemitism. Therefore, this tweet does not constitute antisemitic content as per the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It references Yaroslav Stetsko, a Nazi collaborator who promoted eliminating Jews, using his words as justification for establishing a militia against Jews. This aligns with JDA guideline 7, which warns against applying negative stereotypes or historical references that stigmatize Jews. The tweet perpetuates antisemitism by equating Jews with threats through its content and reference to Stetsko's actions during the Holocaust."
