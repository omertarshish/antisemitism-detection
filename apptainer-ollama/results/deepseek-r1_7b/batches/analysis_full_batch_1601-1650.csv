Someone posted on Facebook and strangers just showing up https://t.co/wVYLDqwgYT,No,"The tweet refers to Jewish individuals appearing at a mosque and does not express any form of hatred, discrimination, or harmful intent towards them. It appears to be a factual observation without any overtly antisemitic content or calls for harm.

The IHRA's definition of antisemitism involves expressions of hatred, which this tweet lacks. Instead, it focuses on an interaction between two groups in a specific location, without targeting Jews negatively. Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.",No,"The tweet in question describes a specific event with minimal context beyond the presence of some Jewish individuals at a mosque. It does not engage in any form of discrimination, prejudice, or harmful stereotype-making against Jews. The tweet is neutral and does not attempt to generalize about all Jews or link them to negative stereotypes related to anti-Semitism as defined by the JDA."

It uses a stereotype that equates Jewish identity with support for Israel, potentially implying exclusion or villainy towards Jews in America. This stereotyping and association fit within the criteria of antisemitism by targeting individuals based on their perceived connection to another group.",Yes,"The tweet aligns with several points from the JDA's guidelines regarding antisemitism. Specifically, it reflects B.7 by suggesting that American Jews are solely responsible for certain actions attributed to Trump and others within the ""right,"" positioning them as agents of Israel without considering their own national interests or identities. Additionally, it touches on B.9 by implying that non-Israeli Jews (American Jews in this context) are more loyal to Israel than their own countries, which is a form of stereotyping and discrimination. These elements together constitute antisemitism according to the JDA's definition."

It makes a stereotypical claim about Jews being interchangeable with Zionists and suggests that all Jews are responsible for Israel's actions, which aligns with antisemitism by perpetuating stereotypes and generalizations. However, the latter part of the tweet directs criticism towards ""Israel Advocacy Movement"" without directly addressing or critiquing Jews, thus not fully embodying the essence of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet employs antisemitic tropes by equating Jews with Zionists and suggesting all Jews are responsible for Israel's actions. This aligns with the JDA definition of antisemitism as it involves lumping Jews into broad categories tied to negative stereotypes, which is a core aspect of antisemitic ideology outlined in guidelines 6 and 7.

The tweet uses classical antisemitic symbols and images (Zionists/Zionism) to negatively portray Jewish identity, thereby contributing to antisemitism. This approach reduces the complexity of Jewish heritage by associating it with harmful stereotypes about responsibility for state actions, which is a recognized form of antisemitism under the JDA framework."

This aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in terms of discrimination based on Jewish identity (denying rights). While it doesn't explicitly express hatred or conspiracies, it involves denying a fundamental right (citizenship), which can be seen as a form of antisemitic discrimination.",Yes,"The tweet discusses citizenship revocation and reinstatement in a manner that could be interpreted as targeting the general population of Jews, without specific context. According to the JDA, this aligns with guidelines 2 (using stereotypes or ideas about evil) and 10 (denying Jewish rights). The general statement about citizenship could imply discrimination against Jewish people, touching on sensitive issues related to their status and rights, which may resonate with existing antisemitic narratives."

It uses a slur against Jews by associating them with economic influence in Congress, which can be interpreted as hatred toward a specific group. Additionally, it ties into a broader context of white nationalism, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and aligning with antisemitic rhetoric.

---

**Analysis of IHRA Definition:**

The tweet from Rep. Tomummer accuses rich Jews of purchasing Congress, labeling this action as antisemitism. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves targeting Jews with hatred, often expressed through negative stereotypes or slurs that imply a collective responsibility for societal issues. The tweet's accusation against Jews based on economic status and political influence aligns with such harmful stereotypes.

Moreover, within the context of rising white nationalism, the tweet reflects anti-Semitic narratives and aligns with the Republican Party's conservative platform, which has been associated with antisemitic statements in the past. This makes the tweet particularly dangerous as it reinforces discriminatory and hateful rhetoric against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet employs the stereotype of ""rich Jews"" controlling Congress, a harmful generalization that essentializes Jews based on their assumed wealth and political influence. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly the use of symbols or stereotypes targeting Jews (guideline 2) and reflects antisemitic ideology by projecting negative characteristics onto a specific group."

If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly."" ~John 10:24 #Bible #God #Hope",No,"The tweet does not directly reference Israel or make Holocaust-related claims, so it doesn't explicitly fall under IHRA's antisemitic definitions related to those topics. However, the use of ""Jews"" in a religious context could be interpreted as perpetuating negative stereotypes about Jewish people within certain religious traditions where exclusionary labels are used. While this interpretation is possible, it depends on the broader context and intent behind the tweet. Without explicit references to antisemitic themes or historical persecution, the tweet may not fully align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not appear to be antisemitic according to the JDA definition. It references a biblical passage, John 10:24, which is presented neutrally without any discriminatory language or stereotype use of Jews. There is no indication that the tweet implies Jews are responsible for any wrongdoing, nor does it target them as a group with negative connotations. Therefore, based on guidelines B and C, the tweet is not antisemitic in nature."

While the IHRA definition focuses on hatred towards Jews, the tweet extends this to other groups without proper context or justification. This stereotyping and generalization align with antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which includes targeting Jewish individuals or communities inappropriately. The tweet's aggressive tone and lack of evidence-based claims further support its classification as antisemitic according to the provided definition.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group or their institutions. The tweet in question uses strong negative language targeting multiple groups, including Jews, but it does not specifically target Jewish people or their institutions beyond general hateful remarks about haters. While the broader context of IlhanMN's statements could align with antisemitist ideologies, this particular tweet is too generalized and does not meet the JDA's specific criteria for antisemitism, which requires targeting Jews as a group. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic under the given definition."

While the IHRA definition does not explicitly forbid such actions if they are not part of a broader conspiracy or discriminatory campaign targeting Jews specifically, the act of advising on how to present oneself could be seen as imposing negative stereotypes or practices that may contribute to antisemitism.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as hatred or systemic prejudice directed at Jews. The tweet targets Jewish people by suggesting a specific behavior (wearing a kippa) as a form of identification, which could perpetuate negative stereotypes and potentially harm Jewish communities. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly regarding antisemitic discrimination and conspiracy theories. Therefore, while the tweet may not directly accuse Jews of conspiracies or actions against humanity, its nature and content could still be classified as antisemitic under the given framework.

In conclusion, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to its potential to stigmatize Jewish individuals through specific norms and practices.",No,"The tweet urging Jews in Germany to wear a kippa and reveal their identity does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

1. **Repetition of Jewish Practice**: Wearing a kippa is a traditional religious observance for many Jews, and promoting this practice is not inherently discriminatory or hostile.

2. **Identity Revelation**: The instruction to ""not conceal identity"" suggests respect rather than discrimination. It does not generalize about all Jews but is a specific advisory based on the U.S. ambassador's guidance.

3. **Lack of Essentialization**: There is no evidence in the tweet that treats Jews as a homogeneous group with inherent characteristics, which is a key aspect of antisemitism defined by the JDA.

4. **Contextual Nature**: The tweet does not imply broader conspiracies or negative associations about Jews without specific context, avoiding coded language typical in antisemitic rhetoric.

Thus, the tweet respects individual choices and religious practices, aligning with principles of equality and respect outlined in the JDA guidelines."

This use of negative stereotypes and denial of factual harm done to Jews aligns with antisemitic practices, making the tweet antisemitic according to IHRA standards.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly equate the denial of the Holocaust to an inherent antisemitic stereotype or use external factors (like Hitler's support) as a basis for anti-Semitism against Jews themselves. Instead, it states that revisionism is anti-Semitic because it denies the slaughter of Jews and was influenced by external causes, which do not inherently tie the act to a Jewish people. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism."

It does not exhibit any overtly hateful language, nor does it imply or target Jews in a way that aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.

This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes that dehumanize non-Jewish groups, using negative language to perpetuate hatred. While the tweet doesn't directly target Jews but uses harmful language consistent with antisemitism by implying non-Jews are inferior or evil without valid basis.

The IHRA considers such behavior as antisemitic because it employs stereotypes and negative character traits that dehumanize Jewish people or their perceived enemies, aligning with the definition provided.",No,"The tweet contains elements that could touch on antisemitism but does not fully meet the criteria as defined by the JDA. While it references an anti-Semitic slogan (""Jews will not replace us""), which is itself an expression of antisemitic ideology, the use of general labels like ""fine people"" without specific context or justification risks essentializing a group and contributing to stereotyping. However, since the tweet does not explicitly apply these labels in a discriminatory manner beyond referencing anti-Semitism, it may not fully align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as involving systematic discrimination or hostility against Jews."

This stereotype could lead to discrimination and denial of opportunities for Jewish individuals, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving harmful generalizations or denials about Jewish people.",No,"The tweet uses a stereotype where the speaker attributes all early Jews to being Arabs. This is problematic because it essentializes Jews into a negative category based on a stereotypical assumption, which aligns with General guideline 1 of the JDA. Essentializing groups leads to discrimination and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jews. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines."

Additionally, by implying that non-Jewish groups like people of color and Danes won't share this trust either, it extends beyond antisemitism to a broader form of discrimination against minorities.

It is an expression of concern and a reaction to incidents, not an antisemitic statement.

The tweet does not reference any antisemitic guidelines outlined in the JDA, such as essentializing Jews, making negative generalizations about a population, or linking Jews to harmful ideas. Instead, it is a straightforward declaration of concern for victims without incorporating any antisemitic stereotypes, caricatures, or coded language typical of antisemitism.

Furthermore, there are no references to anti-Semitic principles like the denial of the Holocaust, support for Israelis, or systematic discrimination based on race. The tweet does not fit within any category of antisemitic expressions as defined by the JDA. It is important to note that while addressing any form of hate speech requires care, this particular tweet falls short of meeting the criteria for being considered antisemitic.

In summary, the tweet is a normal and reasonable statement about the suffering experienced by Jewish people in New York, without engaging in or promoting any antisemitic ideas."

This generalization reduces the value of specific Jewish communities and perpetuates harmful stereotypes. According to IHRA, this aligns with antisemitic ideologies by targeting a group as a whole rather than individuals within it, thereby denying them their right to self-determination or equivalence in support.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Targeting a Group:** The tweet associates support for Israel with support for Jews broadly, affecting any Jewish person not necessarily tied to Israel.
   
2. **Stereotyping:** It simplifies support for Jews by tying it exclusively to support for Israel, creating a biased stereotype about Jewish individuals.

3. **Denying Self-Determination:** By equating support for Israel with support for Jews, it implicitly denies other Jewish people their right to self-determination beyond the state of Israel.

4. **Breadth of Targeting:** The tweet's impact extends beyond Israel, affecting all Jewish communities worldwide, thus aligning with antisemitic principles that target a group rather than individuals within it.

Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it marginalizes Jewish people and aligns with IHRA's definition by targeting them as a whole.",Yes,"The tweet equates support for Israel with support for Jews, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews. This association implies that supporting a state equates to supporting a specific ethnic group within it, akin to point 7 where Jews are held collectively responsible for the nation's actions. Additionally, it references point 6 by applying negative stereotypes or associations to a state, thereby reinforcing antisemitic biases. Thus, this tweet is anti-Semitic according to JDA guidelines."

Okay, so I need to figure out if the tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me start by reading the tweet again:

""@jonathanglennie @DAaronovitch Dear Jews, please look past the Antisemitism and vote Labour. Next week, Dear BAMEs, look past the violent racists and vote BNP (if they still exist!!)""

First, I'll break down what's being said here. The tweet is directed at Jewish people (""Dear Jews"") and Black and Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME) individuals (""Dear BAMEs""). It tells them to ignore antisemitism or racism and vote for Labour and the BNP respectively.

Now, looking at the IHRA definition: Antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews, expressed in various ways. This tweet specifically targets Jews by name and tells them not to be affected by what it refers to as ""antisemitism."" It also targets BAMEs by their perceived race group and advises them to vote for a different political party due to racism.

The IHRA definition includes targeting individuals or groups based on their perceived characteristics, which this tweet does. The language used is about looking past issues related to antisemitism or racism to make voting decisions. This could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes by labeling a group (Jews) as problematic and another (antisemitism) as the issue.

Moreover, it's using terms like ""BAMEs"" which are derogatory, contributing to negative perceptions of certain groups. The call to vote based on these perceived issues aligns with antisemitic behavior where group stereotypes are used to target specific communities for discrimination or hostility.

So putting this together, yes, the tweet is antisemitic because it uses targeted language against Jews and BAMEs, reinforcing negative stereotypes and instructing them to be affected by what it perceives as their group's issues. This fits within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it explicitly targets Jewish individuals (""Dear Jews"") and Black and Asian Minority Ethnic groups (""Dear BAMEs"") by using derogatory language and reinforcing negative stereotypes. It directs these groups to vote against Labour and the BNP, respectively, based on perceived issues related to antisemitism or racism. This behavior aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, as it involves directing hatred and discrimination against specific communities through speech and instruction.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly use anti-Semitic stereotypes or language targeting Jews. It instead advises voters to look past perceived negative traits related to antisemitism for specific political parties. While it encourages understanding of these issues, it does not directly promote or endorse harmful ideologies that could incite hatred against Jewish individuals. Therefore, according to the JDA's guidelines, this tweet is not considered antisemitic as it does not involve discrimination, prejudice, or negative generalizations about a population."

3. **Potential Double Standard**: The tweet could be seen as applying a double standard if such religious views are not widely held outside the Jewish community, thereby potentially labeling them as harmful when they don't align with broader societal norms.

4. **Political Affiliation and Religion**: The hypothetical nature of expulsion ties political affiliations to religion, which may cross into antisemitism by targeting specific groups based on faith or identity rather than individual beliefs.

Given these points, the tweet could be considered antisemitic as it relates to Jewish identity and religiously informed views that may impact perceptions of discrimination."
