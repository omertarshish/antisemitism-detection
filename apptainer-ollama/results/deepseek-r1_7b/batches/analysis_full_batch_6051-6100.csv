**Answer:**  
DECISION: No",No,"The tweet is referencing a passage from the Bible (Acts 12:3) about Jesus treating Jews well and taking Peter, who later became Jesus' apostle.

Dems are in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood (London, Cairo, DC)  as well as China and the Commies in the EU and Ukraine. Hence anti-Israel, anti-American. All spelled out in: https://t.co/NVhkUGm0ft https://t.co/4cgedSHnAV",Unclear,"<think>
Okay, so I need to determine whether the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as provided in their working definition. Antisemitism involves a perception of Jews with hatred, directed towards Jewish or non-Jewish individuals, properties, institutions, etc. It can be expressed through various means like speech, writing, actions, and uses negative stereotypes.

Looking at the tweet: ""YOU HAVE the Dem/Ashkenazi Jews against traditional Jewish population. Dems are in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood (London, Cairo, DC) as well as China and the Commies in the EU and Ukraine. Hence anti-Israel, anti-American. All spelled out in: [links]""

I notice several points here:
1. The tweet refers to ""Dem/Ashkenazi Jews"" which is a specific subgroup of Jews.
2. It compares this group negatively to ""traditional Jewish population.""
3. It accuses Democrats (Democrats) of being in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood in cities like London, Cairo, and DC.
4. It also mentions China, Communist groups in the EU and Ukraine as part of the problem.
5. The conclusion is anti-Israel and anti-American sentiments.

Breaking this down further:
- The term ""Dem/Ashkenazi Jews"" might be using a pejorative label for a specific group within Judaism. However, the IHRA definition doesn't necessarily restrict antisemitism to targeting specific subgroups but rather any perception of Jews as a whole.
- The tweet equates this group with negative entities (Muslim Brotherhood) and political groups (Democrats), implying they are in opposition to traditional Jews.
- It also directly ties this to anti-Israel and anti-American sentiments, which are directed towards nations rather than individuals or properties.

Considering the IHRA's criteria:
- The tweet is making claims about hatred and discrimination against Jewish people.
- It uses negative stereotypes by associating a specific group of Jews with other negative groups.
- It suggests that Jews (as a whole) are responsible for these actions, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes.

However, I should also consider if this falls under antisemitism or some other form of discrimination. The tweet seems to be more about political and ideological opposition rather than direct hatred towards Jewish individuals or properties. It's using metaphors like ""in bed"" to describe relationships between groups, which could be stretching the definition but might still fall under antisemitic rhetoric.

Additionally, while the IHRA defines antisemitism as directed against individuals, properties, etc., the tweet is more about broader groups and systems. But given that it's using negative stereotypes and associating a subgroup of Jews with negative entities, it does touch on the core elements of antisemitism: hatred, discrimination, and targeting of Jewish people or their proxies.

So, putting this all together, I think the tweet is indeed antisemitic because it employs negative stereotypes against a specific group within Judaism and associates them with anti-Semitic groups, aligning with IHRA's definition.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It employs negative stereotypes by associating a specific subgroup of Jews (""Dem/Ashkenazi Jews"") with other negative groups such as Democrats and political entities like the Muslim Brotherhood, China's Communist government, etc. This perception of hatred towards Jewish people or their proxies aligns with antisemitic rhetoric as defined by IHRA, targeting them collectively through metaphors and associations that imply they are responsible for anti-Israel and anti-American sentiments.",Yes,"The tweet employs stigmatization by associating Dem/Ashkenazi Jews with anti-Semitic groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, China's Communist Party, and political entities in the EU and Ukraine. It uses coded language (e.g., ""in bed with"") to imply that these non-Jewish institutions are behind anti-Israel and anti-American sentiments. This approach aligns with JDA guidelines 2 and 3, which address linking Jews to evil forces and using symbols or negative stereotypes to perpetuate antisemitism.

The tweet effectively associates a specific Jewish subgroup with hostile ideologies, reinforcing anti-Semitic views without directly attacking Israel or mentioning specific anti-Semitic acts. Therefore, it qualifies as antisemitic under the JDA definition by employing coded language and associations to stigmatize a particular Jewish identity."

It refers to ""Moorish Jews"" in a historical context without any overtly hateful language or negative stereotypes. Since ""Moorish"" can denote individuals from Morocco, particularly those with Moroccan Jewish communities, the tweet does not target Jews in a discriminatory manner. Instead, it appears as a neutral reference to a specific subgroup's history, fitting within the framework of non-antisemitic speech."

It is a factual inquiry about the relationship between Jews and Israelis, without expressing any hatred, discrimination, or intent to harm.

Therefore, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet in question poses a generalization about whether all Jews are Israelis and vice versa. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews, often based on their being Jewish. Essentializing or making sweeping generalizations can lead to antisemitism, but this particular tweet is more of a cognitive stereotype rather than overt discriminatory behavior. While it touches on sensitive topics related to identity and nationality, it does not directly discriminate against Jews or make statements that could be interpreted as harmful without further context or justification. Therefore, while the question may perpetuate stereotypes, it does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic under the JDA definition.

The tweet is asking whether all Jews are Israelis and vice versa, which is a generalization about an identity that is inherently complex and varies widely beyond geographical boundaries. This type of statement could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes without engaging in discriminatory behavior itself. Since the tweet does not directly discriminate against Jews or explicitly promote harmful narratives based on their Jewishness, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the JDA's definition. However, it is important to recognize that such statements can contribute to a broader cultural understanding of antisemitism and may warrant further discussion or clarification in more sensitive contexts."

The tweet, however, is a critique of progressive individuals rather than targeting Jews broadly. It does not use negative stereotypes about Jews based on their actions but instead attacks a specific group—progressive Jewish people—for their behavior.

While the tweet may incite discomfort among some, it is not antisemitic because it does not meet any criteria for hate speech or stereotyping directed specifically at Jews.

This tweet fits by targeting individuals who made a joke involving Jews with derogatory remarks, thereby perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it involves a direct and discriminatory reference to a specific Jewish person (Yang) by mentioning ""@YangJews.""

It explicitly targets survivors of the Holocaust, implying that Europe’s Jewish people should not seek refuge in Palestine but instead focus on Palestinian Arab countries. This portrayal associates Jews with a negative stereotype, suggesting they are denied opportunities or assistance when more credit is given to their Palestinian Arab counterparts. By singling out Jewish people and using a historical context to justify this discrimination, the tweet violates antisemitic principles that involve hatred toward Jews expressed through speech, criticism, and stereotyping.",Yes,"The tweet criticizes ""appeasement"" toward Palestinian Arabs while supporting Jewish people in seeking a new life in Palestine. This aligns with JDA's guideline 7, which warns against treating Jews as agents of a negative outcome or Israel.

While this could be seen as limiting freedom of expression, it does not directly target individuals or communities based on Jewish identity. Antisemitism typically involves hate speech, discrimination, or prejudice against a specific group, such as blaming them collectively for societal issues or targeting their community. The tweet's focus is on controlling criticism rather than specifically targeting Jews or their communities in an antisemitic way. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria outlined by the IHRA for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to the Rafi Shalom Foundation, which addresses anti-Semitism in Russia, and uses strong language implying ""draconian censorship"" against criticism of Jews.

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination based on being Jewish. This tweet refers to ""Jews"" in a way that could potentially perpetuate stereotypes or negative associations with Gypsys, which are individuals of Indian descent. However, it does not essentialize or generalize about Jews as a group but rather makes a stereotypical comparison between two distinct groups. According to JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group, not necessarily extending to other ethnicities without specific context indicating such intent. Therefore, the tweet is more about representation and stereotypes rather than direct antisemitic discrimination targeting Jews."

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Repetition of JEWS**: The tweet repeats the word ""JEWS"" multiple times without providing specific context beyond religious references.
   
2. **Anti-Semitic Terms**: ""ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION"" and ""DAY 927"" are often associated with anti-Semitic stereotypes or Holocaust denial narratives.

3. **Lack of Context**: Without specific historical or geopolitical context, these terms could be misinterpreted as promoting a negative view of Jews.

4. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: The tweet's themes align with broader anti-Semitic ideas without additional clarification, risking promotion of harmful stereotypes.

In conclusion, while the tweet doesn't directly use coded language, its content and potential interpretations can contribute to antisemitic views by referencing terms associated with anti-Semitic narratives."

This aligns with the IHRA definition as it involves a negative stereotype targeting Jewish individuals, fitting the criteria for antisemitism.

The tweet also draws an analogy between Jews and illegal immigrants, further reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes. By reducing both groups to animals, Trump employs broad generalizations that are often used in antisemitic rhetoric. This form of discrimination is problematic because it denies basic humanity to Jews and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.

Additionally, the IHRA considers expressions that target Jews or their communities as antisemitic if they involve hatred, stereotypes, or blame for societal issues. In this case, Trump's statements are clearly directed at Jewish people and use a dehumanizing stereotype typical of antisemitic behavior.

The statement about illegal immigrants does not negate this, but the focus is on the Jewish label used in the first quote.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Analysis of Hitler's Quote:** Adolph Hitler's quote classifies Jews as animals, which is a clear racial stereotype and form of antisemitism under JDA guidelines (Guideline 2), where such labels are seen as essentializing and discriminatory.

2. **Analysis of Trump's Quote:** Donald Trump's statement targets illegal immigrants, categorizing them as non-human animals. While this also involves stereotyping, it does not specifically target Jews but still exemplifies the use of negative stereotypes, which can be relevant to antisemitism if applied similarly to a specific ethnic group.

3. **Application of JDA Guidelines:** Both quotes involve labeling groups based on ethnicity without providing contextualization or nuance, which fits under JDA's definition (Guideline 3) of using words, images, and deeds that stereotypedly depict groups as non-human.

4. **Conclusion:** The tweet uses stereotypical language directed at an entire ethnic group, fulfilling the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic according to the provided definition."

It respectfully commemorates the Holocaust, references the victims with factual accuracy, and advocates for combating antisemitism while promoting solidarity among all Jews. There are no overtly antisemitic themes, stereotypes, or attacks on Jewish individuals.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as hatred toward Jews, which may manifest in various forms such as speech, writing, visual representations, or actions. However, this tweet does not contain any of these elements. Instead, it honors the victims of antisemitism and serves as a call to action against ongoing antisemitism.

It is important to note that while the IHRA considers acts like Holocaust denial or promotion of anti-Semitic stereotypes as antisemitic, this tweet neither denies the Holocaust nor promotes such stereotypes. It instead focuses on remembrance and advocacy for peace, which aligns with non-antisemitic messaging.

In summary, the tweet does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic as per the IHRA definition because it respects Jewish victims, avoids negative or harmful generalizations about Jews, and serves a constructive purpose in addressing antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not present any form of antisemitism as it honors Holocaust Remembrance Day by acknowledging the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis. It emphasizes solidarity with all Jews in combating antisemitism and promotes a positive message without targeting or using harmful stereotypes about Jewish people. There is no mention of denying Jewish rights, promoting Palestinian demands that could be misinterpreted as denying Jewish identity, or using symbols associated with antisemitism towards Israel. The tweet focuses on remembrance and collective action against antisemitism in an empathetic manner.

The tweet adheres to the principles outlined in JDA guidelines by avoiding any form of discrimination, prejudice, or harmful generalizations directed specifically at Jews or their institutions. It serves as a respectful commemoration without engaging in practices that could be misconstrued as antisemitic."

By linking Jewish heritage to losses caused by Trump, the tweet subtly associates Jews with negative outcomes, thereby aligning with antisemitic principles as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly address antisemitism by targeting Jews as a group with inherent prejudice.

This stereotyping generalizes these behaviors as if they are solely or predominantly Jewish, projecting harmful outcomes without evidence of individual responsibility. According to the JDA, such broad categorizations and associations constitute antisemitism by treating a group based on assumed characteristics linked to inherent evil or power dynamics.

The tweet also perpetuates harmful stereotypes by attributing collective degradation to Jews, which ignores historical complexities where other factors influenced Barcelona's decline. Essentializing entire groups without evidence violates the JDA's guidelines against discrimination and prejudice."

By doing so, it employs inclusive language that may reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews in comparison to these groups. The use of terms like ""Never again"" implies a collective responsibility for attacks on any group, including Jews, which aligns with antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

However, under JDA guidelines, any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their ethnicity is considered antisemitic. Therefore, the tweet does not represent antisemitism as it lacks essentializing claims about Jews specifically or in relation to others without amplifying their persecution.

Wait, no—the initial decision was incorrect because the tweet explicitly targets ""Jews"" among others and uses language that could imply a broader persecution targeting them collectively. Therefore, according to JDA, it is antisemitic.

Additionally, the comparison made between White, Anglo-Saxon Christians and Jews reinforces a racialized view, targeting non-Jews while labeling them in relation to their perceived Jewishness. The language used expresses hatred toward Jews and employs dehumanizing terms, aligning it with the IHRA's definition of antisemitic behavior as it involves directed hatred based on Jewish identity expressed through harmful stereotypes or statements.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition.

While the tweet critiques societal norms (social distancing) and historical persecution, it does not specifically target or focus on Jews as a group based on their Jewish identity.

It suggests that these actions are responsible for societal failures, implying responsibility on behalf of antisemitism as a cause. While the tweet doesn't explicitly target specific individuals or groups, its broad accusations and metaphorical association align with antisemitic rhetoric by reflecting a negative perception of Jews and their communities in relation to societal issues.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly use terms that would fit under the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It discusses the impact of societal failures on lands where Jews face various challenges but does not make broad generalizations or link these issues to Jews as a problematic group, which is essential for antisemitism according to guideline 2.

The statement ""the Jews deserve it"" implies responsibility for harm without addressing individual cases or providing context. While the user's handle suggests a progressive leaning but does not inherently indicate antisemitic intent, the content itself violates IHRA standards by promoting harmful stereotypes and exclusionary language. Therefore, while there is some nuance in the analysis, the tweet does not conclusively meet the criteria for being antisemitic under the IHRA definition.

However, upon further reflection, it's important to note that labeling ""Jews"" as a broad category without addressing specifics can indeed perpetuate harmful stereotypes and exclusion. The IHRA considers such generalizations as antisemitic because they contribute to discrimination and hatred toward an entire group without valid reason. Thus, the tweet would be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to its use of broad language and stereotyping.",No,"The tweet in question does not directly accuse Jews of being inherently evil or associate them with harmful stereotypes. It states a fact about recent violence against Jews and then concludes that the Jews deserve it, followed by labeling it as ""Super woke"" on NBC. While this could be interpreted as justifying violence against Jews, the term ""Super woke"" suggests that the speaker believes their progressive viewpoint supports this stance.

2. **Israel/Palestine Examples**: There are no references or applications of anti-Semitic symbols, stereotypes, or accusations against Israel or Jews. The mention of ""JewsForBernie"" is an identifier for their cause, not a negative stereotype.

3. **Non-Antisemitic Example**: The tweet supports a political figure without engaging in any actions that would target Jews negatively beyond identifying them as Jewish participants in the endorsement.

1. **Essentialization**: The tweet uses a stereotypical image of Jews, equating them with the negative trait of 'leaking,' which essentializes the entire Jewish population into a single group with negative characteristics.

2. **Linking Jews with negative stereotypes**: The term ""jews"" is used without context, potentially implying a broad stereotype that applies to all Jews, which can be manipulated or weaponized against a specific group like Israelis.

3. **Potential for conspiracy theories**: The tweet's language could imply conspiracy elements, aligning with antisemitic ideas about Jews controlling other entities or hidden agendas.

4. **Application of guidelines**: This tweet fits guideline 2 by linking Jews to negative traits and guideline 1 by essentializing their characteristics without specific context.

In conclusion, the tweet uses stereotypical and essentializing language towards Jews, making it antisemitic under the JDA's definition."

The tweet embodies antisemitic themes by questioning the representation of Jews in a work of art, drawing parallels between such misperception and historical atrocities committed against the Jewish people. Additionally, it references mechanisms like gas chambers (point 4) and associates the criticism with Holocaust denial or exaggeration (point 8), both falling under the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the JDA definition.

Therefore, it is not antisemitic as it does not fall under the IHRA's criteria for hatred directed at all or many Jews but instead focuses on a particular subgroup without implying broader negative stereotypes about all Jews.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism according to the JDA. It describes a factual event where Germans deported Polish Jews, including over a dozen, from Tarnów to Auschwitz on June 14, 1940. While it mentions Polish Jews, there is no overtly hostile or discriminatory language towards them as a group beyond their inclusion in the broader context of the deportation. The tweet does not essentialize Jews, target them specifically for evil associations, or use coded messages implying antisemitism. It serves to inform about a historical event without any antisemitic undertones.

The tweet correctly states that this action is part of an exhibition on human rights issues, which is unrelated to antisemitism. It avoids any denial of the right of Jews in any country and does not present them as inherently evil or targets their national identity beyond the context of a historical event. Therefore, it is not antisemitic under the JDA guidelines."

It does not explicitly mention any Jewish individuals or communities, nor does it directly address issues of antisemitism such as conspiracy theories about the Holocaust or demonizing Jews as a collective. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being considered antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly use antisemitic language or stereotypes about Jews. It focuses on rejecting a deal between Trump and Palestinians based on Palestinian rights, using hashtags like #No4DealOfCentury. While the context could imply anti-Israel bias through pro-Palestinian hashtags, there's no direct reference to Jews beyond the initial statement. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

I don�t know when these groups will learn.,Yes,"The tweet in question employs language that equates the hatred Democrats have toward Jews with their hatred toward blacks, which aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. This comparison perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reflects a negative perception of Jews by drawing parallels to another group's negative treatment, thus qualifying as antisemitic according to the provided criteria.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly reference any negative stereotypes or symbols associated with antisemitism, such as those listed in the JDA guidelines. However, by comparing the hatred Democrats have for Jews to their hatred for Blacks, Ted Cruz is reinforcing a stereotype that could imply Jews are less worthy of respect and criticism, contributing to antisemitic views without directly using coded language or negative stereotypes.

The tweet suggests a comparison between two groups treated similarly by critics, which could perpetuate a harmful view of Jews as being less valued. This form of generalization, even if not explicit in symbols, aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism when it implies that Jews are subject to comparable scrutiny or discrimination based on their Jewishness.

Thus, while the tweet may not directly use antisemitic language, its content could be interpreted as reinforcing a harmful stereotype and is therefore considered non-antisemitic in this context."

With prejudice, racism and hatred of the other on the rise again, it's never been more vital that #WeRemember. #HolocaustMemorialDay",No,"The tweet is a remembrance message about the Holocaust and genocide victims. It does not contain any antisemitic language, rhetoric, or stereotypes. It acknowledges the victims without targeting them specifically and does not use any language that would be considered harmful or offensive according to the IHRA definition.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as hate directed toward Jews, expressed through various means including speech, writing, actions, and stereotypes. This tweet focuses on factual commemoration of victims, promoting remembrance, and uses hashtags related to Holocaust observance without engaging in any antisemitic content. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet focuses on remembering the Holocaust and acknowledging current prejudice and hatred towards Jewish people, promoting remembrance without engaging in any form of discrimination or hate speech. It emphasizes solidarity with victims rather than targeting them based on their ethnicity. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitic content as defined by the JDA."

It also discusses the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in a manner that demonizes Jews, potentially implying a historical connection to antisemitism. Additionally, it extends criticism towards Jewish people in America without considering their contributions or well-being, which aligns with antisemitic themes. These elements meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not directly address or target Jewish people or specifically link the Warsaw Ghetto uprising to them. Instead, it simplifies historical context and makes broad statements about fighting racism without any explicit antisemitic content."

It refers to a Holocaust denial group and is shared by Times of Israel, which actively opposes Holocaust denial and antisemitic ideologies. There are no mentions or implied statements about Jews, their communities, or any negative stereotypes or conspiracies related to antisemitism in the tweet.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly contain any content that directly addresses or promotes antisemitism as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It discusses a French town where a Jewish community elected a mayor from a party founded by Holocaust denier. While Holocaust denial can be linked to anti-Semitic ideologies, the tweet itself does not contain overtly anti-Semitic language or promotion of such views. The neutrality of the content and its focus on an election context suggest it does not violate JDA's definition of antisemitism. Additionally, retweets from The Times of Israel are typically critical of antisemitism, but without explicit ties to Holocaust denial being highlighted in this tweet, it is considered non-antisemitic based on the information provided."
1247018289173278720,DavidJohnWeave,2020-04-06 04:28:23+00:00,1,Jews,@Angel5Christine @DwitterWitz Just like the Jews in NAZI Germany!,Yes,"The tweet in question employs the slur ""Jews"" and makes a negative comparison to individuals associated with Nazi Germany, potentially inciting hatred. While it doesn't explicitly target a group but uses slurs and historical references that could be offensive, it aligns with IHRA's criteria for antisemitism by associating Jews with negative stereotypes and historical events.",No,"The tweet uses references to Jews in Nazi Germany as a basis for comparison regarding the individuals named in the handle (@Angel5Christine and @DwitterWitz). This equates them with a problematic group, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes or lumping an individual into a broader, negative category. However, without explicit context suggesting a direct link to antisemitism beyond generalizable stereotypes, the tweet does not directly meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism. The use of such references could be seen as stereotyping but may fall short of constituting actionable antisemitism unless it implies exclusion or hostile treatment based on Jewish heritage without additional context.

Wait, upon re-evaluation, given that the tweet equates the individuals to a historical anti-Semitic group (Jews in NAZI Germany), it does involve a form of stereotyping and lumping an individual into a negative category. This aligns with JDA guidelines about treating groups as having inherent characteristics or linking them to evil traits. Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic.

DECISION: Yes"
