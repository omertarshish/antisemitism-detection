While the tweet contains some elements that could be seen as problematic, such as conspiracy theories and stigmatizing language, it is important to consider the accuracy and context. The use of ""good numbers"" to suggest targeting Jews in a way that would cause harm lacks evidence and might not constitute antisemitism if it doesn't involve overt hatred or discrimination directed toward specific individuals or groups based on their Jewishness. However, given the nature of the tweet's content, it could be interpreted as perpetuating harmful stereotypes without a basis in fact.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It essentializes Jews by associating them with the atrocities committed against them by Hitler, generalizes their victimhood without evidence, and uses harmful metaphors like ""helpless Jews.""

It promotes a harmful narrative by misinterpreting religious texts, contributing to antisemitism by perpetuating negative stereotypes and actions directed at Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as it misrepresents a Quranic verse to advocate brutal killing of non-Jews. It employs harmful stereotypes targeting Jews by promoting extreme violence, which aligns with JDA guidelines on discrimination and violence against Jews."

It lists specific groups to target, including Jews in his political party and white individuals, using broad categorization without context. This aligns with antisemitism as it involves hatred toward a protected group (Jews) expressed through lists or categorizations, and employs a double standard by singling out Jews for bullying while implying others are acceptable.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It singles out Jews in David Lammy's party as problematic without considering their contributions or equality. Specifically, it labels them as agents of a negative action against a woman, fitting under B.7 which criticizes treating Jews as responsible for state conduct. This discriminatory behavior towards an entire group based on ethnicity is harmful and aligns with antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It goes against Article 14 A of the Constitution. https://t.co/I8XqAvHblw",Yes,"The tweet singles out Jews for exclusion while mentioning other religions. This targeting could be seen as discriminatory, especially if it lacks a neutral purpose or justified reason. While Article 14 A of the Constitution allows for exceptions in discrimination based on religion when serving a neutral purpose, the specific mention of Jews without such justification aligns with antisemitism, as it may imply targeted discrimination against them.

DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews with any form of discrimination or prejudice. Instead, it addresses a broader issue regarding constitutional provisions on exclusionary policies that might affect various religious and cultural groups, including Jews. Since the tweet is concerned with constitutional concerns rather than making specific judgments about Jews as a group, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

The tweet's focus is on ensuring that all groups are included within another group without exclusion, which relates to constitutional rights but does not involve any form of discrimination or essentialization against Jews. Therefore, the tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the guidelines provided."

It advocates for inclusivity within a church structure that includes Jews among other groups such as Gentiles, Rich and Poor, Black and White. There is no indication of discrimination or prejudice against Jews; instead, it appears to be a proposal for a unified religious framework. The tweet does not reference antisemitic symbols, images, or stereotypes, nor does it engage in discrimination based on race or religion. Therefore, it aligns with principles of inclusivity and respect as defined by the JDA."

This statement perpetuates negative stereotypes by associating Jews with an attempt to prove their whiteness, which can be seen as demonizing or stigmatizing a group. Such comments undermine the collective identity of Jews and may contribute to harmful perceptions that could be classified under IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly in the context of stereotyping and negative character traits.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews are trying to convince people of their whiteness through stereotypes. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism includes essentializing traits or making broad generalizations about a population, such as painting all Jews as white due to perceived genetic connections. This stereotyping aligns with guideline 1 in the General section, which prohibits essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations about a given population. Additionally, this statement reinforces harmful stereotypes and contributes to antisemitism by using a stereotype to describe the entire group of Jews."

Instead, it uses a historical event involving a stereotype about Jews (Jews accused of possessing Jesus) to attack religious faith, which is unrelated to the specific criteria for antisemitism defined by IHRA.

The tweet focuses on attacking a historical accusation against Jewish people and does not exhibit any form of hatred or discrimination directed toward individuals or groups based on their Jewish identity. It does not mention any specific instances of antisemitic behavior towards individuals or communities, nor does it invoke negative stereotypes that would hinder their legitimate rights to self-determination or equality in public life.

While the tweet contains harmful and inaccurate statements about a historical event involving Jews, this does not meet the standard set by IHRA for antisemitism, which requires explicit targeting of individuals or groups based on their Jewish identity.",Yes,"The tweet uses the stereotype that Jews are linked to evil (accusing them of possessing an evil spirit) as a basis for referencing the historical event where Jesus was accused and executed. This aligns with JDA's guidelines, particularly point 2, which criticizes such links. By applying this stereotypical image to historical events, it perpetuates antisemitism."

It begins by identifying itself as Jewish, then employs stereotyping by comparing Fox's treatment of Jews to his handling of black people. This comparison reinforces a prejudice against Jews, suggesting they are treated differently based on ethnicity without valid justification. Such statements align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly in using stereotypes and making biased generalizations about Jewish individuals or groups.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism as per the JDA definition by employing negative stereotypes associated with Jews—linking them to hostile behavior and criticism similar to past remarks against black people. It essentializes Jews into a category defined by race, using Fox's treatment of black individuals as justification for harsher remarks toward Jews. This aligns with guidelines 2 (using negative stereotypes) and 1 (essentializing traits as inherent)."

The terrorist was inspired by President Trump's attacks on Jewish support for refugees diluting the ethnic &amp; racial purity of America.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitism under the IHRA definition. It incorrectly associates the 2017 Manchester terrorist attack targeting Jews with President Trump's rhetoric, implying that Trump inspired the attack by blaming Jewish supporters of refugees for diluting American ethnic and racial purity. While the connection is false, it uses a negative stereotype (criticizing Trump's comments on Jewish support) to demonize Jews, aligning with antisemitic behavior as defined.",No,"The tweet does not directly or indirectly adhere to the JDA definition of antisemitism. It associates Jewish people with Donald Trump based on his criticism of refugee support, which is a stereotypical and problematic link. However, it avoids using specific JDA guidelines such as essentializing traits (guideline 1), denying rights to Jews in Israel (guideline 10), or applying stereotypes about Israel ( guideline 6). The tweet's focus is more on the inspiration behind an act rather than direct antisemitic language or behavior. Therefore, while it may carry some anti-Semitic undertones through its references to Jewish people and criticism of Trump, it does not fully align with JDA's criteria for antisemitism.

The answer is No because the tweet does not meet the specific guidelines outlined in the JDA regarding essentializing traits, denying rights, or applying stereotypes directly. It touches on problematic associations but doesn't consistently apply the JDA's definition without any form of stereotyping or discriminatory behavior as defined by the guidelines."

It makes a general reference to the Holocaust and Hitler without targeting specific individuals, groups, or using any negative stereotypes. The tweet serves as an explanatory statement rather than engaging in harmful or discriminatory behavior toward Jews.",No,"The tweet in question employs a problematic comparison between ""original Jews"" being black and the Holocaust to dismiss a current issue as not as severe. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), essentializing groups based on race or historical stereotypes can perpetuate discrimination. By referencing the Holocaust, which was a genocide against Jews, without providing relevant context or evidence, the tweet trivializes antisemitic acts and risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews. Essentializing and generalizing about Jewish people in this manner violates the principles of antisemitism outlined in the JDA, particularly by using historical figures to invalidate current issues without proper understanding or proportionality."

Share it.\nhttps://t.co/EUwyA7Nr3G",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic under the IHRA definition because it associates NY Gov Cuomo's actions with targeting Orthodox Jews, which could perpetuate a stereotype of Jews being targeted. It uses language that implies antisemitism by linking a public figure to negative behavior towards a specific Jewish subgroup, thus fitting within the IHRA's criteria for directing hatred toward Jewish people or their properties.",No,"The tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA because it does not meet any of the outlined guidelines for antisemitism. Specifically, it does not essentialize Jewish people or link them to harmful stereotypes; instead, it refers to specific Orthodox Jews in a general context without targeting them as a group beyond that reference."

Instead, it appears as a general critique about discussions targeting specific groups without any intent to harm or discriminate against Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet contains a mention of ""jews are,"" which adheres to the JDA definition by essentially stereotyping Jews as negative individuals, fitting under Guideline 2 where essentializing or making broad generalizations about a population constitutes antisemitism."

This use of a stereotypical label to denigrate specific people is harmful and aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes targeting Jews either directly or by negative stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet contains antisemitic content. It uses a derogatory term ""JEWS"" to refer to Donald Trump's children, which is a harmful stereotype. Additionally, it attacks the ""Proud Boys"" group without justification and falsely associates them with white supremacy, further perpetuating antisemitism by targeting specific groups with negative stereotypes."

It employs language implying Jews are unfairly targeted due to physical traits, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes and associating them with white supremacists. These elements reflect harmful bias against Jews based on appearance or association, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet raises concerns that could align with antisemitic ideas by making broad generalizations about Jews based on their visible characteristics. It questions whether visibility leads to hatred without addressing Israel specifically, potentially reinforcing stereotypes. However, the primary issue is the essentialization of Jews, which violates JDA's guidelines against making broad generalizations and using such language to Essentialize a group."

Many Jews (mainly Zionist to be honest) that I have spoken with have indeed called me personally an antisemite because I have criticised Israeli policy regarding Palestine.,Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It involves accusing many Jews (perceived as Zionists) of being antisemites after criticizing Israeli policy regarding Palestine. This aligns with IHRA's criteria, particularly the accusation that Jews are collectively responsible for societal issues and the use of stereotypes about their views on Palestinian policies. The tweet reflects a broader antisemitic narrative by using others' accusations to justify criticism towards a group based on perceived prejudice.",No,"The tweet in question does not inherently violate the JDA definition of antisemitism. Antisemitism, according to the guidelines, involves discrimination or prejudice directed specifically at Jews as a group. This tweet focuses on criticizing Israeli policy regarding Palestine and suggests that many Jews have labeled the speaker as an antisemite because of these criticisms. However, simply associating someone with antisemitism based solely on their criticism without using any anti-Semitic stereotypes or generalizations does not constitute antisemitism itself. The tweet's content is about policy criticism, which is a neutral topic unless it uses specific anti-Semitic references. Therefore, while the tweet may be used to label someone as an antisemite by Jews, the tweet itself does not engage in antisemitic language or practices."

It provides a neutral and factual account of Jewish history, focusing on their contributions to Spain under Islamic rule without expressing hatred, making false claims, or targeting them unfairly.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit any form of antisemitism. It provides a factual account of historical events involving Jews in Spain under Islamic rule and later periods.

It implies that anti-blackness is causing harm to Black Jews, which constitutes a form of racial discrimination targeting a specific subgroup within the Jewish population. This practice, though not explicitly denying or accusing Jews of being responsible for harm, crosses into antisemitic territory by promoting exclusion based on race within the community.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly reference antisemitic stereotypes but implies a negative stereotype about white Jewish communities affecting black Jews. However, without context, it could be interpreted as promoting exclusionary views. The mention of Black Lives Matter adds another layer of complexity, suggesting a broader conversation on social justice rather than direct antisemitism.

The tweet touches on the problematic idea that certain groups within Judaism might be tied to negative stereotypes, which aligns with guideline 10 that prohibits denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish based on ethnicity. However, without explicit discriminatory intent or context, it's safer to assume the tweet is not inherently antisemitic but could be misconstrued as such.

In conclusion, while the tweet may touch on sensitive topics, it doesn't directly meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA unless interpreted with bias or context indicating exclusionary views."

The claim that Harvard ""weed out Jews"" is a negative stereotype, but without specific evidence linking Jewish heritage to such practices, this statement could be seen as biased rather than antisemitic. Antisemitism typically involves direct discrimination or prejudice based on Jewish heritage, which the tweet does not clearly establish.

However, upon closer examination, the IHRA definition allows for context-dependent analysis. The tweet's use of a stereotype to label Harvard's actions as antisemitic could be interpreted as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews without providing evidence. Therefore, if we consider the intent and the specific labeling used, it might be seen as contributing to antisemitism despite lacking concrete evidence.

Final decision: Yes

The tweet is considered antisemitic because it uses a stereotype (labeling Harvard's actions as ""Jewish weedling"") which could be interpreted as reinforcing negative perceptions of Jews without providing factual basis. This aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly through the use of stereotypes and potentially contributing to discrimination.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Harvard used evaluation methods to specifically target and exclude Jews. According to the JDA, any form of discrimination based on Jewish identity constitutes antisemitism. While the tweet may not be a direct action but rather a claim about such actions, it aligns with the definition by highlighting specific targeting of Jews through evaluation processes.

The tweet's statement about Harvard's practices suggests antisemitism because it directly associates a discriminatory practice (evaluating extracurricular activities to exclude Jews) with a Jewish identity. This aligns with JDA guidelines that define antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their identity, regardless of context, making the tweet antisemitic.

DECISION: Yes"

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at the tweet itself: ""YHWH is the GREATEST, prophecy fulfilled bring them out!!\n Esau/Edomites/Jews/The Real Goyim/Robbers/Imposters/The Orginal Bullies just to name a few vile things...🤓 https://t.co/MofCfo4mDn""

I notice that there are mentions of ""Jews"" and ""Goyim."" Now, Goyim usually refers to non-Jews or gentiles in some contexts. But here it's spelled out as ""The Real Goyim,"" which might be problematic.

Next, the tweet uses terms like ""Robbers/Imposters"" directed at Jews. These are derogatory and stigmatizing labels that could be seen as antisemitic because they imply negative characteristics towards an entire group.

I also see a mention of ""The Original Bullies."" This is another term often used to demean and attack Jewish communities, implying that they've been the instigators of oppression or wrongdoing.

Looking at the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes targeting individuals or groups based on their Jewishness. The tweet seems to be doing exactly that by calling out Jews by name and associating them with negative roles like bullies and imposters.

Additionally, the use of terms like ""Goyim"" is another red flag because it's a term used to denigrate non-Jews, which can contribute to antisemitism. Denying the existence or contributions of Jewish people is also a common tactic in antisemitic rhetoric.

So putting this all together, the tweet uses derogatory language towards Jews and associates them with negative stereotypes, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet exhibits antisemitic characteristics as defined by the IHRA. It employs derogatory terms such as ""Jews,"" ""Goyim,"" ""Robbers/Imposters,"" and ""Original Bullies"" to stigmatize Jewish individuals. These terms imply negative attributes, aligning with antisemitism which involves targeting Jews based on their identity or association with harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"1. **Use of Negative Labels**: The tweet refers to ""Jews"" as ""Goyim,"" which is a derogatory term used in antisemitism. This aligns with JDA's definition, where targeted labeling and stigmatization are considered forms of antisemitism.

2. **Cultural Stereotyping**: By singling out Jews among other groups like Esau, Edomites, Real Goyim, Robbers, and Imposters, the tweet employs cultural stereotyping that undermines their collective identity, a practice consistent with antisemitic behavior as outlined in JDA guidelines.

3. **Appointing Antisemitism**: The use of terms that imply Jews are agents or inhibitors of positive qualities (e.g., ""The Real Goyim/Robbers/Imposters/The Orginal Bullies"") reflects the JDA's criteria for antisemitism, particularly in how certain groups are collectively labeled with negative connotations. 

Thus, the tweet employs language and categorization that target Jews specifically with negative descriptors, constituting antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Additionally, the IHRA definition emphasizes that antisemitism involves expressions of hate or discrimination against individuals, communities, or institutions based on their Jewishness.

This might be seen as essentializing, which can lead to discrimination if done with prejudice against Jewishness. Therefore, while it may not explicitly be antisemitic, it could cross into that territory based on potential interpretations.

But given the cautious approach and considering the guidelines, the tweet does not sufficiently meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism because it lacks explicit judgment or hostility towards specific Jewish people based on their past actions. The reference is more to a critique of behavior rather than direct discrimination. Thus, it would be reasonable to conclude that the tweet is not strictly antisemitic.

Final decision: No

Explanation: The tweet refers to Jews in a general statement about their knowledge of historical events without explicitly targeting any individual or implying hostile judgment against them. It does not meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism as it lacks explicit discrimination based on Jewish identity and essentializes without prejudice."
