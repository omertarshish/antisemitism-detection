Okay, so I need to figure out if the tweet provided is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. First, I should probably go through each part of the definition and see how it applies.

The tweet says that armed white supremacist protestors are waving confederate flags and signs that declare Jews to be ""the real plague"" to defend their right to spread a deadly virus. The mayor then scapegoats Jewish neighbors. 

Starting with the IHRA's definition, antisemitism is about hatred towards Jews, expressed in various ways‚Äîverbal, physical, toward individuals or groups, institutions, etc. It uses negative stereotypes and can be part of broader conspiracy theories.

Looking at the tweet: it's targeting Jews by calling them a ""real plague."" That seems to fit because it's expressing hatred towards a specific group, Jews. The use of a confederate flag is more about white supremacists, but they're associating themselves with anti-Semitic rhetoric directed toward Jews. The mention of spreading a deadly virus also ties into conspiracy theories, which can be a form of antisemitism as seen in Holocaust denial or other conspiracy narratives.

Additionally, the tweet uses a well-known symbol (confederate flag) to spread a message, which could be an attempt to use familiar symbols to incite hatred. It's also reinforcing the idea that Jews are responsible for some negative outcome (spreading a virus), which aligns with antisemitic accusations of Jews being conspirators or controllers of societal issues.

So, considering all these points‚Äîdirect hatred towards Jews, use of symbols associated with anti-Semitism, and tying Jews to a negative action‚Äîit seems like the tweet does fit the IHRA definition.

DECISION: Yes

The tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it expresses hatred toward Jews by calling them ""the real plague."" It uses the confederate flag, often associated with white supremacists and anti-Semitic rhetoric, to spread a message that incites hatred. Additionally, it ties Jews to a conspiracy related to spreading a deadly virus, reinforcing negative stereotypes and conspiracy theories about Jewish responsibility for societal issues. These elements align with antisemitic behaviors as defined by IHRA, which include making negative accusations against Jews or leveraging familiar symbols to incite hatred.",No,"The tweet uses several elements that align with antisemitic practices according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Firstly, it associates Jews with a ""real plague"" and their role in spreading a deadly virus, which incorporates harmful stereotypes and stigmatization. This ties into guideline 2 of the JDA, where Jews are linked to evil or negative traits. Additionally, it denies the right of Jews in Israel to exist by implying they should be scapegoated for this perceived wrongdoing, which aligns with guideline 10. The tweet also uses symbols like confederate flags to propagate antisemitic ideologies, contributing to the classification under guideline 6. Overall, these elements together suggest that the tweet is indeed antisemitic."

The tweet states that ""Some Jews oppose it,"" but without specifying what ""it"" is, making its context unclear. It discusses cultural norms regarding sexual damaging in Jewish tradition, which could be seen as a general statement rather than an act of antisemitism. Antisemitism typically involves directed discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their identity, which this tweet does not exhibit. Instead, it appears to reflect cultural awareness without targeting any specific group negatively beyond their faith practices.

The tweet's content is neutral and does not engage in any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews.

The tweet states that ""Ashkenazi Jews do like circular food,"" which is a neutral and specific statement about a subgroup within the broader Jewish community.

According to JDA guidelines:
1. Antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group based on certain characteristics.
2. The tweet does not generalize about all Jews but refers specifically to Ashkenazi Jews, who are already a well-known subgroup with distinct cultural backgrounds.
3. It is important to avoid using negative stereotypes without justification and without implying any inherent evil or bias beyond the specific context of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as involving hatred towards Jews, either directly or through systemic discrimination.

**Final Answer:**

DECISION: No  
The tweet ""Jews in revolt"" does not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA definition because it lacks explicit hate speech or direct discriminatory actions against Jewish individuals. It expresses sentiment towards Jews but doesn't meet the threshold of antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

While this could be seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes, it doesn't specifically target or attack Jews as individuals or groups in the State of Israel. The main issue lies in oversimplifying historical contexts without addressing deeper systemic issues, which is more complex than a straightforward antisemitic act.

The tweet's comparison might imply a reductionist view, conflating different historical events to lump together groups under a common trope, which could be seen as contributing to negative stereotypes or simplification rather than direct antisemitism. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for being antisemitic according to the JDA definition provided.

However, if we interpret the tweet's statement about incitement towards Muslims as an endorsement of hate speech that targets Muslims similarly to historical actions against Jews, this could be seen as inciting violence or perpetuating stereotypes.

There are no references to denying or minimizing the Holocaust, applying negative stereotypes of Jews in Israel, or supporting policies that would be considered antisemitic. Instead, it reflects a religious and legal directive within an existing framework, without engaging in practices outlined as antisemitic by the JDA.
