During the selection SS doctors sent 1,936 people to be murdered in gas chambers. 500 men &amp; 364 women were registered in the camp as prisoners.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it does not exhibit any form of hatred or negative portrayal towards Jews. It provides factual information about the deportation and murder of Greek Jews without making any discriminatory remarks, stereotypes, or associations that would constitute antisemitism.",No,"The tweet accurately reports historical facts regarding the deportation of Greek Jews by the Nazis in 1943 to Auschwitz, where some were murdered. It does not exhibit any form of discrimination or prejudice against Jewish people; instead, it reflects a documented historical event without any negative stereotyping or bias towards any specific group within the Jewish community.

The tweet is factual and neutral, merely stating that a group of Jews (Greek origin) was deported and subjected to murder by the Nazis. It does not generalize about all Jews, nor does it use any language that would be considered antisemitic. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic because it does not engage in discrimination or violence against Jewish people as a group; it simply states historical events involving a specific subgroup within the broader category of Jews."

This is why we should not allow even one person to be put in detention centres. come what may. !!! https://t.co/pdweBE9JoC,No,"The tweet does not meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism. While it uses a historical analogy to describe a genocide, it does not explicitly target Jews or make broad negative judgments about their people or state (Israel). It avoids deploying classic antisemitic stereotypes and instead makes a general comparison without specific targeting. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet's statement compares starvation to the Holocaust targeting Jews, using this to justify preventing detention centers. While it draws on historical persecution of Jews (linked to evil), the context shifts to imply broader discrimination or persecution against others. This aligns with JDA guidelines that prohibit stigmatizing or hostile generalizations about Jewish groups."

It portrays an individual without making any negative or hostile remarks about Jews, focusing instead on her characteristics as a Muslim, Iraqi American, and refugee.

Therefore, the tweet is not classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit any form of antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It respects and celebrates the individual's identity as a Muslim, Iraqi American, and refugee. There are no negative stereotypes, hostile generalizations, or coded language typical of antisemitic behavior. Instead, it focuses on her positive attributes without attacking her Jewish heritage.

The tweet adheres to principles 2, 3, 4, and 10 of the JDA by avoiding any association between Jews and evil forces or harmful imagery. It also complies with guidelines regarding respectful discourse and does not promote exclusion based on race or ethnicity. Therefore, it is an appropriate statement that respects diversity without engaging in antisemitic narratives."

It expresses a perception of antisemitism by equating Democrat support with harm to Jews, potentially implying symbolic or institutional targeting through its reference to Jewish-owned businesses in Harlem and Jersey City. The use of broad language like ""killing Jews"" directly conveys hatred towards an entire group. While it doesn't explicitly name individuals or actions, it aligns with the IHRA's criteria for expressing hatred and negative stereotypes about Jews.",No,"The tweet does not directly address antisemitism but uses language that could imply support for harmful ideologies. It equates certain Democratic actions with harm to Jews without providing specific evidence, potentially suggesting a defense of antisemitism through racial generalizations (A2). Additionally, it frames Democrat support as acceptable without addressing the antisemitic nature of such claims, which aligns with the guidelines against essentializing and promoting harmful stereotypes.

Wait, after reconsidering, I realize that the tweet itself doesn't explicitly endorse or promote antisemitic ideologies but rather criticizes them. It mentions that Democrats oppose racism yet considers certain actions (like supporting Jewish stores) as justified, which could be seen as justifying antisemitism through a racial lens. This aligns with A2 of the JDA.

Final decision remains No, but let me adjust my reasoning to reflect this properly.

While it uses language that implies discrimination against black and brown people, the primary target is a specific Jewish group rather than all Jews collectively. According to IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves targeting Jews or their communities with hatred, which this tweet does not directly fulfill since it focuses on a particular group without engaging in stereotyping or generalizing against all Jews. The criticism appears to be more about the actions of a specific Jewish entity rather than overtly denying or harming Jewish people as a collective. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews or link them to harmful stereotypes associated with antisemitism. While it makes general statements about white people representing others, these are broad and do not specifically address Jews or the context of Israel/Palestine as outlined in the JDA guidelines.

Firstly, it references ""Jews funding invasion"" due to Soros funds supporting immigrants. This statement is problematic because it oversimplifies complex economic and immigration dynamics into a stereotypical narrative, potentially blaming Jews for issues without factual basis or context. Secondly, it suggests that this funding led to the murder of Pittsburgh Jews while they were praying, conflating historical antisemitism (such as the Holocaust) with contemporary events in an unsupported manner. This conjunction of conspiracy theories and stereotyping constitutes harmful generalizations about Jewish people, which can be seen as delegitimating their community. Additionally, the tweet's tone and use of fear to suggest integration of antisemitism into society further reinforces a negative stereotype. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet exhibits antisemitic content through its misuse of historical contexts, stereotyping, and conspiratorial language targeting Jews.",Yes,"The tweet employs several JDA guidelines related to antisemitism. It associates Soros funds with Jews controlling global systems (point 2 and 3), uses coded language about Jewish influence (point 4), and applies these stereotypes to Israel, aligning with example 6.

The tweet makes a generalization by linking all Jews to the COVID-19 pandemic without evidence, which falls under essentializing a group (guideline 1) and is harmful because it dehumanizes and associates an entire population with a disease.

Instead, it reflects a societal observation rather than direct antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, which involves explicit targeting or negative perceptions of Jews themselves.",No,"The tweet addresses the frustrations of the Black community in Brooklyn regarding issues like illigality and job availability.

Instead, it is a collective call to stand together against any victims, including those from other marginalized groups like Romani people and disabled individuals.

Thus, it does not meet the IHRA's criteria for targeting Jews specifically or through harmful rhetoric.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It factually lists the groups targeted by the Nazis during the Holocaust, including Jews. It does not essentialize or generalize about any group beyond acknowledging their historical targeting. There is no use of harmful stereotypes, symbols, or labels that would fall under JDA's definition of antisemitism.

It mentions Jews in a context that could be interpreted as targeting them negatively or using pejorative language. The use of the hashtag #MEMRIReports suggests it is being flagged for antisemitism, aligning with the IHRA's criteria for discussing and highlighting such issues.",Yes,"The tweet references an Imam discussing topics including ""Jews"" and ""gays,"" with a mention of coronavirus. While the mention of COVID-19 is neutral, the focus on Jews within this context employs a negative stereotype associated with antisemitism, as per JDA guidelines. The use of a figure of speech or stereotype to target Jews could constitute antisemitic behavior, even if the content otherwise appears unrelated.

**Final Decision:** Yes

The tweet uses a stereotypical reference to Jews in the context of an Imam's message about coronavirus and gays, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism outlined by the JDA."

The tweet adheres to the JDA's definition by remaining neutral and not engaging in discrimination based on Jewish identity.

The tweet refers to a vague target labeled ""@ASavageNation"" and then explicitly names Jews as a group to be judged negatively.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Definition Check:** The tweet's main content is a political inquiry about voting behavior in the U.S., specifically among Jews. It doesn't reference or imply any discriminatory traits or group-based discrimination, which are central to antisemitism.

2. **No Negative Stereotypes or Symbols:** There are no images, symbols, or references that align with classical antisemitic stereotypes (e.g., portrayal of Jews as grotesque or using coded language like ""the Rothschilds control the world"").

3. **Lack of Collective Responsibility Claims:** The tweet isn't making any statements about Jews being collectively responsible for another action without context, which would be problematic if true.

4. **Political Speech Context:** The tweet is framed within a podcast and doesn’t use any human rights protections to justify its content. It's presented as a neutral political question rather than an antisemitic assertion.

5. **No Denial of Rights:** There’s no suggestion that the right of Jews to exist or vote is being denied, which would be a form of antisemitism if true.

6. **Proper Political Context:** The tweet doesn't engage in any manner that would align with coded speech or biased political rhetoric targeting specific groups based on ethnicity.

Thus, the tweet complies with human rights protections and doesn’t meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by the JDA."
