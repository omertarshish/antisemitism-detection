Why is the E� https://t.co/poLV9GT017,No,"The tweet poses questions about incidents in France, Malmo, and Paris regarding the departure of Jewish people and the burning of churches. While it could be interpreted as raising concerns about Jewish displacement, there is no overtly antisemitic content such as calling for harm, using negative stereotypes, or blaming Jews collectively. The statements are neutral inquiries without targeting specific Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet employs a code word (""Jews"") to link the events of churches on fire and Jews leaving Malmo and Paris without direct accusation. In the JDA, such stereotyping is considered antisemitic as it associates negative traits with Jews via symbols or stereotypes, potentially reinforcing harmful narratives even if not explicitly stated."

While mentioning Jews in this context is accurate, it does not exhibit any form of antisemitism as defined by IHRA. The statement honors their memory without targeting all Jews or using harmful stereotypes.",No,"The tweet discusses historical atrocities committed by the Nazis involving Jews but does not explicitly deny their existence or use any language associated with antisemitism. It uses the term ""Jews"" to refer to victims without engaging in harmful stereotypes or denying their right to exist, thus it does not meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism as outlined."

It remains focused on speculative comments without targeting any group negatively.",Yes,"The tweet in question references a statement about questioning the loyalty of Jews, which can be interpreted as employing a stereotype or negative stereotype towards the Jewish community. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), treating a group based on stereotypes that imply inherent qualities such as disloyalty is considered antisemitic under guidelines 3 and 6. Even without explicit context about the nature of the woman's critique, the mention of loyalty towards Jews can be seen as reinforcing negative perceptions and thus aligns with antisemitic practices."

Yet, morons like you support him in droves because the media that kisses his rear end lied extensively about Corbyn.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews but uses broad language that could be misinterpreted as involving antisemitic stereotypes, particularly through comments about the media biasing against Corbyn and calling minorities ""terrible things."" However, it is more focused on general attacks on minorities rather than specifically targeting or making harmful statements about Jews. Therefore, while there are elements of stereotyping, they do not directly address Jews, thus not fully meeting the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA. It references media control by linking it to ""Jews"" and accuses minorities of being ""terrible things."" This associates a specific Jewish group with negative actions against them, aligning with point 7 under B. Israel and Palestine: examples that are antisemitic, which warns against treating Jews as agents of a state or institution due to their Jewish identity. The tweet uses coded language about media bias, reinforcing stereotypes that target Jewish people specifically, thus qualifying it as antisemitic."

It employs derogatory language, which is a form of dehumanization, directed at individuals who may be perceived to represent Jews through their association with Corbyn. This stereotyping associates a political figure with Jewish people, thereby targeting them indirectly. Additionally, the offensive remarks and potential negative perceptions towards Jews are consistent with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.

The tweet's use of symbols (like Corbyn) to represent Jews aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which includes using such symbols or references to target Jewish individuals or communities negatively. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic under the given definition.",No,"The tweet uses the term ""Jews"" in a derogatory and sarcastic manner, but it does not engage with antisemitism as defined by the JDA. Antisemitism involves discrimination or negative stereotypes specifically directed at Jews or their institutions. Here, the reference to ""Jews"" is part of a broader political critique and does not meet any specific category under the JDA's guidelines for antisemitism. The tweet seems to be making a joke about political affiliations rather than targeting Jews inherently."
1211426841568972801,JoLissa13,2019-12-29 23:20:40+00:00,0,Jews,RT @Cernovich: Nothing from the SPLC about last night�s domestic terrorist attack against Hasidic Jews. https://t.co/n9gJXc6R0H,Yes,"The tweet refers specifically to an attack against Hasidic Jews by domestic terrorists and mentions that the SPLC does not recognize this as terrorism. This could imply targeting of a specific Jewish subgroup, which aligns with antisemitism under the IHRA's definition. While the tweet itself doesn't explicitly accuse all Jews or use harmful symbols, its context suggests discrimination against a marginalized Jewish group without addressing broader Jew concerns, thus contributing to antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet refers specifically to a domestic terrorist attack against Hasidic Jews, targeting a specific Jewish community rather than making broad statements about all Jews. According to JDA guideline 7, antisemitism involves collectively holding Jews responsible for a state's actions or treating them as agents of that state. However, in this case, the tweet does not generalize such treatment; it instead directs criticism at a specific subgroup within Judaism.

Furthermore, the JDA emphasizes that antisemitism is based on inherent characteristics of Jewishness, not on particular religious or community affiliations. Since the tweet targets Hasidic Jews specifically and does not imply discrimination against all Jews, it aligns more with targeted actions rather than systemic or ethnic-based discrimination as defined by the JDA."

This aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as involving negative perceptions and potentially harmful actions directed at Jews. Although the tweet itself is observational rather than directly causing harm, it touches upon antisemitic tendencies by highlighting a behavior that could lead to discrimination or prejudice against Jews. Therefore, it meets the criteria for being classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet discusses @Tpopularfront gravitating towards specific individuals, particularly Jews, using the term ""obsessed."" While this could be interpreted negatively, it doesn't essentialize or generalize about Jews. It's more of an observation of behavior without targeting the group as a whole, thus not meeting antisemitism criteria per JDA guidelines."
1163221795874336768,SustainergyA,2019-08-18 22:51:02+00:00,0,Jews,When President Trump tweets �Dems have such disdain for Israel� he is by extension saying the vast majority of Amer� https://t.co/kfbARQW8dN,No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly target specific Jews or their community institutions but instead associates the Democratic party with anti-Semitism regarding Israel. While it may perpetuate stereotypes that link political parties to anti-Semitic views, it does not directly address individual Jews or invoke antisemitic stereotypes related to their community. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.

However, upon closer examination, the tweet could be seen as indirectly attacking Jewish people by associating them with the Democratic party's opposition to Israel, which might be interpreted in a way that targets their communities. Yet, since it does not directly reference individual Jews or invoke specific antisemitic stereotypes (like conspiracy theories about a world Jewish conspiracy), it may not fully align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.

In conclusion, while the tweet may have the potential to incite harmful sentiments towards Jewish people by equating them with anti-Semitic political parties, it does not meet the IHRA's specific definition of antisemitism as outlined in their working document.",No,"The tweet attacks Democrats by associating their disdain for Israel with all Americans, effectively using a stereotype to generalize against a group based on a negative trait related to Israel. This aligns with the definition of antisemitism as it essentializes or generalizes about a population without evidence.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Core Issue:** The tweet uses a stereotype by linking Democrats' dislike for Israel to all Americans, which could imply that being American means supporting Israel.
   
2. **Apply JDA Guidelines:**
   - **Guideline 2:** Essentializing or generalizing about a population is racist. Here, the tweet treats Democrats as a homogeneous group based on their association with Israel.
   - **Guideline 3:** The tweet manifests antisemitism through words by applying stereotypes to a group (Democrats) associated with Israel, affecting the broader American population.

3. **Conclusion:** The tweet's broad generalization and stereotype usage fit within JDA's framework of antisemitism, targeting Jews collectively without basis in evidence or context."

While it does not explicitly express hatred towards Jews but could invoke a stereotypical image of Jews, which is part of antisemitic stereotypes that associate Jews with negative connotations. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, it can be considered antisemitic as it involves a perception or stereotype directed at an entire group.",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). According to the guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence directed at Jews or Jewish institutions. This tweet focuses on solidarity between Jews and Muslims near a mosque entryway in New York City. It does not exhibit any form of antisemitic behavior such as discrimination, stigmatization, or harmful generalizations about Jews. The message appears to be positive and peaceful, promoting unity rather than targeting or attacking Jews based on their identity."

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by employing negative character traits and categorizing Jews based on perceived political views without respect to their individuality or context.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It essentializes religious Jews by labeling them as conservative, isolationist, and anti-social justice without providing evidence or justification. This aligns with JDA guidelines 1 and 2, which prohibit essentializing a group based on perceived traits and link it to antisemitism. The tweet uses stereotypical characteristics that can lead to discrimination and reinforces negative stereotypes about religious Jews."

How then� https://t.co/CFlvHWhx1a",No,"The tweet draws a parallel between historical atrocities committed against Black people and those attributed to Jews, implying that Jews weren't sufficiently vocal or protective historically. While it uses the term ""Jews"" specifically, it doesn't target them exclusively beyond this shared context. It falls within permissible criticism of historical atrocities without constituting antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not directly attack or stereotype Jews. It uses historical context about slaves and their suffering as a prompt for reflection, not targeting Jews specifically. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, it is not antisemitic because it doesn't involve discrimination, prejudice, or negative generalizations against Jews."

It involves solidarity with Palestinians and a statement about chanting for freedom, which is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet does not accuse Jews of conspiracies or hatred towards humanity; instead, it suggests collaborative action aimed at promoting freedom. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA criteria.",No,"The tweet promotes solidarity between Jews and Palestinians focusing on their mutual desire for freedom and does not contain any discriminatory language or imply anti-Semitic stereotypes. It aligns with principles of non-racism and positive solidarity, making it not antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines."

This involves targeting a specific group (Jews) and associating them with a negative perception directed at their ethnicity or beliefs. It employs a stereotype by singling out Jews as a group that is perceived negatively, fitting the IHRA definition which includes using negative character traits to label a group, such as Jews, as being hated. Therefore, this tweet exhibits antisemitism as it associates a subgroup (Jews) with negativity and demonization.",No,"The tweet does not directly associate Jewish people with babies, airplanes, or cows but lists them together with ""Democrats hate"" without specifying any connection to their Jewish identity. Instead, it simply groups these items as things Democrats hate. While the act of listing specific groups could be seen as a stereotype or generalization about a group (Jews), the tweet does not explicitly link them in a way that suggests discrimination based on their Jewishness. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA because there's no overt reference to treating Jews differently or implying they are inherently tied to negative traits without context."

This aligns with antisemitic themes as it implies a broader association of targeted behavior toward a Jewish group without specific evidence. The language used reflects a stereotype or collective accusation against Jews, fitting within the IHRA definition which includes directing negative perceptions or actions toward a specific group.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It specifically criticizes a congresswoman's actions towards an individual without generalizing about Jews or Israel, thus avoiding all prohibited categories and principles outlined in the guidelines."

Instead, it reports on a statistic regarding public perception of Jews' focus on the Holocaust without any overtly antisemitic intent. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic as it lacks direct expression of hatred or blame towards specific Jewish individuals or groups.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the JDA guidelines. It presents a statistic about Germans' views on how much Jews discuss the Holocaust, without essentializing or making broad generalizations about any population. There is no reference to Israel, nor does it employ harmful stereotypes or coded language typical of antisemitism. The tweet's content focuses on data and analysis, not on discrimination based on ethnicity or religion."

It correctly states the event's impact on Jewish communities, avoiding any antisemitic language or stigmatization. Therefore, it doesn't meet the IHRA criteria for being antisemitic.

DECISION: No",No,"The tweet does not exhibit any characteristics outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It simply announces Kristallnacht, a historical pogrom against Jews in Nazi Germany. The tweet does not incorporate antisemitic stereotypes or symbols associated with Israel, nor does it advocate for any form of antisemitic speech or actions. It remains neutral and factual about the event without endorsement or criticism that could be classified as antisemitic."

It also employs stereotypical language by implying that eyewitnesses are unreliable, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews. Additionally, questioning the marching of Jews from a Russian context could be conflating anti-Semitic views with historical events like the Holocaust, thus contributing to antisemitic perceptions despite the use of slang rather than direct anti-Semitic terms.",Yes,"The tweet uses the word ""jews"" in quotes with a lowercase 'j' and criticizes them for being massacred while questioning the reliability of eye witnesses. It also suggests that Jews should be marched away from Russian advancements without evidence, which could imply a hostile view towards Jewish people within Israel. This aligns with JDA's guidelines, particularly point 10, which prohibits denying the right of Jews to exist in Israel as Jews. The use of negative language and questioning the reliability of statements about Jewish individuals or groups may also touch on antisemitic elements by essentializing or making broad generalizations about Jewish people."

Instead, it uses a general critique of categorizing Jews without targeting any particular group or expressing explicit hostility. The language used is more of a humorous or satirical comment rather than an expression of antisemitic sentiment.",Yes,"The tweet employs negative stereotypes by referring to ""good"" and ""joker"" as descriptors for some Jews. This aligns with JDA guideline 3, which identifies antisemitism through words that demean or stereotype a group based on ethnicity. The use of such terms essentializes Jewish identity, treating their character as inherent rather than acknowledging individual diversity. Additionally, the categorization reflects prejudice rooted in ethnicity, contributing to antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA."

Without additional context showing such actions, the tweet itself does not meet the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It expresses a religious belief in the chosen people status of Jews as a matter of faith without engaging in discrimination or hostile behavior. While such beliefs can sometimes lead to stereotypes, this particular statement is neutral and does not imply any form of harm or prejudice against Jews. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the given guidelines."

By stating, ""All Jews are Zionists,"" it simplifies a complex identity and applies negative language directed towards a specific individual targeted as Jewish. This aligns with IHRA's definition by employing antisemitic stereotypes to attack the targeted group and its leader, thereby qualifying as antisemitic speech.",Yes,"The tweet uses a negative stereotype by generalizing all Jews as ""Zionists,"" which aligns with B.1 of the JDA. This categorization equates all Jews to Zionists, reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes and discrimination against Jewish individuals."

It is a factual statement about a religious event involving Jews, reflecting their normal religious observance without any discriminatory intent or dehumanizing remarks. Antisemitism would involve expressions of hatred, discrimination, or demonization directed against Jewish people, which this tweet does not contain.

The IHRA's definition of antisemitism focuses on hate speech, discrimination, and dehumanizing stereotypes targeting Jews as a group. Since the tweet is merely an announcement about a religious event attended by Jews, it falls within the realm of normal religious practice and does not meet the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet announcing 100,000 Jews gathered for Selichot prayers at the Western Wall is not antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

The tweet does not target specific individuals, groups, or express hateful sentiments towards Jews. Instead, it reflects a historical event without any overtly antisemitic language or actions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA's working definition.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly or implicitly align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

---

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Antisemitism under JDA:** Antisemitism is discrimination based on Jewish heritage, involving hate, prejudice, hostility, or violence. It can manifest in words, actions, or both.

2. **Analyzing the Tweet Content:** The tweet mentions ""Jews"" attending Congress and cheering over an antisemitism bill. There's no explicit mention of negative stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or direct discrimination against Jews in this context.

3. **Applying JDA Guidelines:**
   - **Guideline 4:** Coded speech requires context to identify intent. Without specifics on the bill's content or the Cheering's implications, it's unclear if it ties into antisemitism.
   
   - **Guideline 10 & Others:** These relate more to situations involving Israel and denial of Jewish rights, which isn't addressed here.

4. **Conclusion:** The tweet doesn't provide enough context to suggest antisemitic intent or application of negative stereotypes about Jews attending Congress. Therefore, it's not inherently antisemitic based solely on the information provided."

This false claim about Trump's support for violence against Jews is a form of antisemitic speech, as it falsely associates Trump with hatred toward Jews and undermines the IHRA's criteria regarding overt behaviors like public accusations directed at a specific group.
