This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly the criterion regarding criticism directed toward the state of Israel. By framing Professor Harare from Israel as a divine figure, the tweet may inadvertently perpetuate harmful stereotypes and associations tied to Jewish identity, thus qualifying as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question, ""#BiggestRevelationOf2021"", contains a mention of Saint Rampalji Maharaj from Israel being referred to as a ""Divine great man of India."" This reference appears to be a cultural or religious accolade without any indication of antisemitic intent. Antisemitism, as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. However, this tweet does not exhibit any form of such behavior; instead, it seems to be a general promotion and cultural reference without targeting Jews in a negative way. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as per the JDA guidelines."

Instead, it attacks Palestinians under the incorrect and unrelated term ""apartheid,"" which was a historical policy against Black South Africans, not Jews or Israelis. Therefore, it does not meet the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves directed hatred toward Jews through various means.",No,"The tweet uses the term ""apartheid,"" which is rooted in South Africa's history of institutionalized racial segregation against Black Africans. By associating this term with the Palestinian cause, the tweet potentially generalizes an entire population based on historical actions committed by a state in their past. This aligns with JDA guidelines that caution against essentializing populations and making broad negative generalizations, especially when linking an ethnic group to historical injustices committed by another's state. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being non-antisemitic under the given definition."

It focuses on a person from India and a religious figure without referencing any Jewish individuals or groups, nor does it contain any content that would be classified as hatred towards Jews.",No,"The tweet in question does not directly reference or promote anyone who would be considered a Jewish figure, nor does it use language that aligns with the specific criteria outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. While the mention of ""The Messiah"" could theoretically touch on themes related to antisemitism due to its association with Jewish concepts, the tweet itself does not explicitly or overtly attack Jews, their culture, or promote any form of discrimination based on Jewish identity as defined by the JDA guidelines.

The key points from the JDA that would classify a statement as antisemitic include:

1. Essentializing race, ethnicity, or religion.
2. Using metaphors implying Jews are inherently evil or linked to negative traits.
3. Exaggerating negative stereotypes about Jews.
4. Denying the Holocaust or minimizing its impact.

The tweet does not engage with these points. Instead, it focuses on promoting a figure and referencing a concept (""Messiah"") that could be associated with Jewish lore but is not used in a way that aligns with any of the JDA's specific guidelines for antisemitism. Therefore, without overtly attacking Jews or their practices as defined by the JDA, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic under the given criteria."

It critiques Israeli policy regarding COVID-19 measures, specifically addressing whether they are equally applied to Palestinians in the occupied territories. There is no targeted perception or hatred directed toward Jews; instead, it is a statement about policy fairness and lacks any discriminatory language or conspiracy theories related to Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitic content.",No,"The tweet ""@voellig Israel except for how they‚Äôre not vaccinating Palestinians in the occupied territories"" does not explicitly target or stereotype Jews based on their identity regarding the issue of vaccination. While it brings up the group ""Jews,"" there is no clear indication that the lack of vaccination is attributed to Jews or used as a basis for discrimination against them. The tweet primarily critiques Israel's policy towards Palestinians, which may be seen as a broader critique of state actions rather than specifically targeting the Jewish community. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism."

While this statement could be interpreted as targeting Israel and thus indirectly targeting Jews, it does not meet IHRA's definition of antisemitism. Antisemitism, according to the IHRA, involves specific forms of hate speech or discrimination directed against Jews, including their communities, institutions, or property, often using negative stereotypes or invoking conspiracy theories about Jews controlling global institutions. The tweet in question is a political statement regarding Iran's actions against Israel and does not contain any elements such as hate speech, stereotyping, or denial of the Holocaust. It focuses on a political decision rather than addressing Jews themselves with discriminatory language or imagery. Therefore, it does not constitute antisemitism under IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet reports on Iran's parliament considering a bill to destroy Israel without expressing support or opposition.

Therefore, it does not meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet contains elements that align with antisemitic themes according to the JDA. It generalizes about Gaza residents loving Israel, implies a collective fault on behalf of Hamas, and supports narratives where Palestinian unity is blamed for economic issues, potentially reinforcing anti-Semitic stereotypes by implying non-Jewish responsibility for Jewish problems.

Instead, it refers to actions taken against non-Jews from another land and their treatment relative to Israel.

Antisemitism involves targeting or perceiving Jews in a way that is hateful and often ties to conspiracy theories or negative stereotypes. This tweet focuses on vaccine distribution in occupied territories, specifically mentioning Israel's stance towards Palestinians. It does not attribute any form of hatred or conspiracy directed at Jews but rather addresses a neutral policy issue without incorporating antisemitic ideologies or language. Therefore, it is not classified as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit characteristics of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here's why:

1. **No Use of Symbols or Images**: The tweet does not employ any symbols, images, or stereotypes typically associated with antisemitic rhetoric, such as those linking Jews to evil or hidden conspiracies.

2. **Factual Statement Without Stereotypes**: It is a straightforward factual statement about Israel's policy on vaccine distribution in occupied territories, without making any negative judgments or stereotypes towards Jewish peoplehood.

3. **Contextual Focus**: The tweet addresses a geopolitical issue concerning health policy, not personal characteristics or stereotypes that could be misapplied to Jews.

4. **No Denial of Rights or Stereotypes**: There is no denial of the right for Jews to exist and prosper; instead, it highlights a policy decision without any antisemitic undertones.

Thus, based on these considerations, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic according to the JDA's guidelines."

It references Just Israel, a known anti-Semitic organization that frequently propagates narratives aimed at marginalizing Jewish communities. By linking the rejection of UN funding for the Wannsee Conference to bias against Jerusalem, it aligns with anti-Semitic tropes where groups are blamed for broader societal issues without addressing real injustices or using historical events tied to Jews in misleading ways. This incitement of hatred and the use of slurs or negative stereotypes within a political context fit within the IHRA's framework.",Yes,"The tweet references the rejection of UN funding for the commemoration of the Wannsee Conference, which was a Nazi initiative targeting Jews. According to JDA guidelines, such an action aligns with antisemitism by opposing commemoration of a period that involved persecution and extermination of Jews. The tweet does not explicitly clarify the reason for the funding rejection beyond ""alleged bias against Jerusalem,"" but given the context of the Wannsee Conference being directly tied to Nazi anti-Semitic actions, it supports the conclusion that the tweet is antisemitic."

The tweet uses stereotypical language (""little goblins"") to describe a group it refers to as running a website, which is problematic.
