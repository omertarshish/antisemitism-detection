According to the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves hatred toward Jews expressed through various means such as rhetoric, physical acts, or institutions, this tweet does not fall under any of those categories. It is a neutral acknowledgment of a Jewish community outside of Israel and does not involve any negative stereotypes, harmful rhetoric, denial of rights, or association with harmful conspiracy theories. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic.

The IHRA defines antisemitism as involving hatred toward Jews, which can manifest in speech, writing, visual forms, and action through harmful stereotypes or negative character traits. The tweet does not engage in any such activities; instead, it is a factual recognition of an ethnic Jewish group outside Israel. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic under the IHRA's working definition.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It is simply acknowledging the recognition of Ethiopian Jews by the Chief Rabbinate, which reflects a legitimate aspect of Jewish religious and cultural practices. There is no inherent discrimination or stigmatization directed at any particular population of Jews; instead, it pertains to affirming their legitimate status within their faith community."

The comparison also includes trans people in Western democracies without targeting them towards antisemitism. The tweet's content does not meet the IHRA criteria for antisemitism as it lacks explicit hatred toward Jews and does not use symbols or metaphors typical of antisemitic discourse.

It employs exclusionary language (""us"") that targets Jews, suggesting others are indifferent while focusing on them as the ones affected by rising antisemitism. Additionally, it broadens accusations against Jews regarding societal issues and may use negative stereotypes to shift blame onto them, fitting the criteria of antisemitism involving hatred, discrimination, and collective blame-shifting.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly adhere to the JDA definition of antisemitism. While it references a rise in antisemitism and attributes it to Jews (""us""), this use is problematic because it essentializes Jews without evidence or context, potentially singling them out for exclusionary language. However, since the user is focusing on their own group (Jews) regarding a broader societal issue rather than directly targeting specific actions against Jews, it doesn't fully meet the criteria of antisemitism as defined by excluding or singling out Jews inappropriately without basis.

The tweet uses ""us"" to refer to Jews in the context of rising antisemitism, which could imply a form of exclusionary language. However, the JDA's definition emphasizes acts against Jews themselves rather than collective references about their group regarding external events. Thus, while there is a mention of Jews in relation to a societal issue, it doesn't sufficiently align with the structured criteria for antisemitism outlined by the JDA.

Therefore, based on the provided guidelines and analysis, the tweet does not conclusively demonstrate antisemitism as defined."

Since it does not single out any particular Jewish people or attack their status as a collective, it does not meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.

This constitutes an expression of hatred and a form of antisemitism under the IHRA's definition, as it involves targeting specific individuals perceived or referred to as Jews in a dehumanizing manner.

The tweet refers to three individuals by their names, using the term ""jews"" in place of their full names, which is a derogatory stereotype. This falls under the category of antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which includes expressions that target Jews either directly or through negative stereotypes. The use of ""goblins"" further escalates the antisemitic tone by implying innocence and harm towards Jewish individuals. 

Moreover, the tweet's intent is to convey a perception of negativity towards Jewish people, even if indirectly through nicknames and metaphors.

Okay, so I need to determine whether the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA's definition. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll review the IHRA's working definition of antisemitism. It states that antisemitism involves hatred directed at Jews, expressed through various means like speech, writing, actions, etc., using negative stereotypes or blaming Jews for societal issues. Specific examples include targeting Israel as a whole, making false claims about a world Jewish conspiracy, denying the Holocaust, and using symbols associated with antisemitism.

Now, looking at the tweet: ""AND SO THE WHITE PEOPLE began calling themselves 'WHITE JEWS' like today, that inhabit devil's murderous White Supremacist White Superiority Nazi Gestapo Hitler Israel of the Middle East, still demon Communist guided today, the WHITE JEAWS impostor fraud people,""

I notice several key points. The user refers to ""THE WHITE PEOPLE"" as a group and then calls them ""WHITE JEWS."" This directly associates a racial group with Jews, which is a common antisemitic stereotype. They also mention the Nazi Gestapo, Hitler, and Israel, implying some connection or blame on these entities towards Jews.

The tweet uses terms like ""White Supremacist White Superiority,"" which reinforces a negative image of Jews tied to white people. It also refers to the Nazis, suggesting that their actions (like persecution) are related to Jews, which is another form of stereotyping and historical distortion.

Moreover, the mention of Israel being ""Communist guided"" adds an accusation against a Jewish entity for political reasons, which aligns with the IHRA's definition where Jews are blamed collectively or for broader societal issues.

I should also consider whether this tweet could be seen as invoking the Holocaust denial. The user refers to the Nazis and their atrocities but doesn't explicitly deny or attack the Holocaust directly; however, combining such references with anti-Semitic labels can amplify antisemitic stereotypes.

The use of the term ""impostor fraud people"" towards White Jews is another layer that fits the definition—denying their capabilities or character traits in a negative way.

Additionally, the tweet seems to mix historical and racial slurs against both white people and Jews, using terms like ""NAZI,"" which could be seen as part of anti-Semitic rhetoric aimed at blaming Jews for these actions.

Considering all these elements—the use of racial slurs, stereotyping Jews, associating them with negative historical figures, and the overall context of blaming Jews for these actions—it strongly fits within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. The tweet is using harmful stereotypes and associating a racial group with Jews in a derogatory manner.
</think>

DECISION: Yes

The tweet exhibits clear elements consistent with antisemitism as per the IHRA's definition:

1. **Stereotyping**: The use of ""WHITE JEAWS"" directly associates a racial group with Jews, a common antisemitic stereotype.

2. **Negative Stereotypes and Allegations**: The tweet refers to the Nazi Gestapo, Hitler, and Israel, implying a negative image of Jews tied to white supremacy and historical atrocities.

3. **Denying Hol Holocaust**: By associating the Nazis with antisemitism, it subtly links Jewish people to these actions, though not explicitly denying the Holocaust itself.

4. **Collective Responsibility**: The tweet suggests that Jews are collectively responsible for Nazi actions against Israel, aligning with IHRA's criteria of holding Jews accountable for broader societal issues.

5. **Racist and Denying Slurs**: The terms ""WHITE PEOPLE"" and ""White Supremacist White Superiority"" reinforce negative racial slurs tied to Jews.

Overall, the tweet uses harmful stereotypes, associates a racial group with Jews, and implies blame on Jews for historical atrocities, meeting multiple criteria of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs several elements that align with antisemitic definitions under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It labels ""WHITE PEOPLE"" as ""WHITE JEAWS,"" using derogatory terms that essentialize a population. The association of Jews with the Nazis and their atrocities, such as the Gestapo, is a common trope but problematic when used to demean an entire group. The tweet also describes Israel as a White Supremacist state, suggesting Jews are involved in historical atrocities against Whites, which constitutes hostile discrimination based on Jewish identity. These actions and associations meet the criteria for antisemitism by promoting prejudice and essentializing Jewish people."

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), essentializing—a form of racism—is part of antisemitism if it marginalizes a group without justification.

Therefore, while the tweet touches on issues related to Jewish rights, it does not meet all criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not present as antisemitic according to JDA.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Tweet Content:**
   - The tweet challenges historical consensus that the land of Israel doesn't belong to Jews and criticizes contemporary views supporting this stance, claiming such views are wrong today.

2. **Applying JDA Guidelines:**
   - **Guideline 10:** Denying the rights of Jews in Israel is directly addressed as it argues against their collective rights.
   - **Guideline 15:** The tweet's criticism doesn't use a ""double standard"" but rather aligns with a view that the world is wrong when asserting Jewish lack of rights.

3. **Analysis:**
   - While it references historical denial, it does so without explicitly denying the Holocaust or using coded language typical in antisemitism.
   - The focus remains on correcting historical misrepresentations and contemporary claims, not attacking Jewish identities directly but rather the validity of their rights.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The tweet doesn't meet JDA's standards for antisemitism as it doesn't endorse denial of Holocaust facts or collectively deny Jewish rights without a basis in historical or factual error."

I commend them for their restraint. Just like my fine people shouting Jews will not replace us.,No,"The tweet does not explicitly target specific Jewish individuals or groups. While the mention of ""Jews"" could be interpreted as a stereotype, the context involves a comparison between two events and does not directly attribute blame to a group based on their identity. Therefore, it doesn't meet the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism, which requires targeting or stereotyping Jews specifically.

DECISION: No",Yes,"The tweet contains a stereotyped reference to ""Jews"" in quotes, which targets the Jewish group without context or justification. This aligns with JDA guideline 2, as it uses a harmful stereotype implying that Jews are not contributing positively and could be replacing valuable people."

( most arent )\n2 most jews in isreal are ashkanazis (not true)\n3. most Ashkenazim are white (most cant pass as white )",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitic behavior by employing harmful stereotypes and generalizations about Jewish people. It equates Jews with white individuals, which is a false stereotype that many Jews are not and cannot be. Additionally, it claims that most Ashkenazim can pass as white, reinforcing the notion of racial superiority within the Jewish community, which is incorrect. These statements perpetuate negative and inaccurate perceptions, aligning with antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet exhibits antisemitic elements by employing stereotypes and denying the right of Jews, particularly Ashkenazim, to identify as white or pass as such. It misrepresents Jewish heritage to invalidate their rights in Israel, aligning with guidelines that condemn such denial of equality and stereotyping."

It promotes a form of hatred towards Jewish people through strong emotional language suggesting elimination in favor of comfort, potentially inciting fear or hatred. While the statement doesn't explicitly target Jews, it manipulates perceptions to spread anti-Semitic views, fitting within the broader category of promoting hatred and exclusion against a specific group. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic according to IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet promotes a harmful ideology that equates living in a Palestinian state with being killed by Jews. It uses words like ""rather die while killing Jews"" which are antisemitic, as they promote violence against Jews. This aligns with guidelines 2 (linking Jews to evil), 3 (prohibiting deeds or words harming Jews), and the overall promotion of antisemitic ideologies."

It employs a comparison that associates Trump's remarks with Nazi actions against Jews, reinforcing antisemitic views by targeting a specific ethnic group with negative connotations.

---

DECISION: Yes",Yes,"The tweet from Acosta employs harmful stereotypes and generalizations by comparing Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric to historical anti-Semitic actions against Jews. By calling undocumented immigrants rapists, criminals, and low IQ individuals and drawing a parallel to Hitler's targeting of Jews, the tweet uses language that is antisemitic as defined by the JDA. This involves projecting negative stereotypes onto a group similar to those used historically against Jews, thereby violating guidelines on discrimination based on ethnicity or association with Jewish institutions."
