This statement targets Soleimani, a significant political figure known for supporting militias against Western influence in Iraq and Iran.

The use of capitalization on ""jews"" highlights a stereotype, often used in antisemitic rhetoric to target the Jewish community negatively. The reference to their trending at 6am may imply negative behavior associated with being late or inactive during that time, which aligns with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism involving negative perceptions and stereotypes directed toward Jews.",No,"The tweet ""Why were jews trending at like 6am"" does not inherently contain antisemitic content according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet is simply posing a question about why a certain trend was trending early in the morning, without any discriminatory language or references. Since there's no context suggesting it was tied to negative stereotypes or prejudice against Jews, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

It highlights a historical event (exclusion of Jews) and draws a parallel to the Holocaust, which is relevant but not inherently antisemitic. Antisemitism involves targeting or stigmatizing Jewish people specifically, either directly or through negative stereotypes. While the tweet's intent may touch on exclusionary themes, it does not explicitly or stereotypically target Jewish individuals or generalize in a way that would constitute antisemitism according to IHRA's definition.

The tweet is educational and does not employ harmful stereotypes; however, its approach risks oversimplification of complex historical issues without providing nuanced context. Therefore, while it may inadvertently touch on exclusionary themes, it does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic as per the given definition.",No,"The tweet is not inherently antisemitic but could be interpreted as perpetuating a historical context of exclusion against Jews. While it presents factual information about the 1930s exclusion of Jews from Europe and later their expulsion from the U.S., it does not explicitly use discriminatory language or directly address antisemitism. However, by referencing these historical events without context, it might be used to justify or perpetuate anti-Semitic narratives."

Jews are distinct enough from the majority to be labelled alien, but resemble the majority just enough to simultaneously be accused of infiltration. Antisemitism gets them coming and going.",Yes,"The tweet employs the term ""alien"" to describe Jews, which is a common antisemitic stereotype. This label associates Jews with being outsiders or different from the majority, potentially leading to discrimination or exclusion. Additionally, it suggests that Jews are being infiltrated, implying they are responsible for negative societal outcomes, another hallmark of antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet uses harmful language and stereotypes to target Jews, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not fully adhere to the JDA's definition of antisemitism because it does not explicitly or overtly meet any of the criteria outlined, such as discrimination, prejudice, or hostility directed specifically at Jews based on their identity. The language used touches on themes related to antisemitism, such as labeling and infiltration, which are often part of broader antisemitic narratives. However, without direct engagement in discrimination or prejudice against specific groups based on Jewish identity, the tweet does not conclusively qualify as antisemitic under the JDA's definition."

It does not involve hatred towards Jews, nor does it use stereotypical language or attributes negative emotions specifically to Jewish individuals or communities. Instead, it critiques AIPAC's stance on Israel and the reactions from Israelis in response to exit poll changes, without targeting or blaming Jews directly.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic content as defined by the JDA. It refers to glowing reviews from American Jews about Israel at AIPAC and an emotional reaction from Israelis to exit poll changes, which is a neutral political commentary without targeting any specific group negatively or essentializing any population based on ethnicity.

The key points are:
1. The tweet does not use any negative stereotypes or symbols towards Israelis.
2. It refers to the situation neutrally without discrimination against any specific group.
3. The mention of modern Zionism is part of a political discussion, aligning with the principle that criticism of Israel should be based on national self-determination and not involve antisemitic elements.

Thus, no antisemitism is present in this tweet according to the JDA guidelines."

FOH,No,"The tweet humorously criticizes jokes about Jews being put in ovens while disapproving of jokes regarding Black people picking cotton. This does not explicitly express hatred or systemic discrimination toward Jews, fitting within the IHRA definition as it does not constitute antisemitism but rather a critique of the content's context and implications.",No,"The tweet employs a stereotypical comparison between Jews being baked into pies (implying inferiority) and Black people picking cotton, which reflects harmful associations.

The tweet violates guidelines 2 and 3 by linking Jews to evil (here, the Nazis) and providing examples that stigmatize them. It also aligns with guideline 10 by denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish without justification or context, which can be seen as implying inherent wrongness.

Furthermore, the tweet's strong negative statements about a group without context or proportionality could be interpreted as discrimination or prejudice, fitting under the definition of antisemitism. Therefore, it is classified as antisemitic according to the JDA."

The tweet mentions Ruth Rogoff and Salo moving to Britain in 1940, a time when anti-Semitic policies were prominent. The phrase about being ""probably our turn"" could imply persecution of Jewish individuals or communities, fitting the IHRA's definition as it involves expressions of hatred and targeting of Jews. Additionally, the tweet's content references actions taken against Jewish people during a period when such behavior was illegal, thus aligning with IHRA's examples of antisemitic acts that are criminal.

2. **Direct Criticism of Behavior**: While it critiques the behavior of those who forgive violence against Jews, this is done without employing coded language, symbols, or references to anti-Semitic stereotypes.

3. **No Use of Prohibited Forms**: The tweet does not reference historical denial (e.g., Holocaust) or align with any specific guidelines that would classify it as antisemitic, such as grouping Jews with evil forces or using anti-Semitic symbols.

4. **Factual Criticism**: It is a critique of behavior rather than making generalizations about the population, thus avoiding the first guideline's concerns about inherent character traits.

DECISION: Yes",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It employs ""Zionists"" as a term that can be pejorative, referring to Jews who support Zionism or Israeli nationalism. However, in this context, it serves more as a historical joke and satire rather than an overtly anti-Semitic statement. The tweet's primary aim is to critique perceptions of victimhood without targeting Jews as a group. Additionally, the use of ""women"" and ""transphobes"" broadens the scope beyond antisemitic discrimination. Thus, while there may be room for interpretation regarding the term ""Zionists,"" the overall message does not align with JDA's definition of antisemitism."

The use of such language without context for what ""F"" stands for further complicates its interpretation but leans toward it being used as an antisemitic slur.

3. **Historical Context Manipulation**: By associating past actions (even when Israel didn't exist) with current antisemitic behavior, the tweet manipulates history to fit a negative narrative against Jews, which is a form of antisemitism.

4. **Use of Antisemitic Terminology**: The tweet employs terms that are typical in antisemitic rhetoric, such as associating historical events with current actions without accurate context.

---

**Final Answer**
DECISION: No",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

The tweet draws a historical parallel between the targeting of Jews in Turkey through the Varlık Vergisi tax in 1942 and modern-day political actions taken by the left, specifically referencing the Kemalist party's advocacy. This reifies Jews as victims of past discrimination and associates them with policies that could perpetuate antisemitism today. By equating historical practices to current rhetoric and actions, it manipulates negative stereotypes and reinforces antisemitic ideologies."
