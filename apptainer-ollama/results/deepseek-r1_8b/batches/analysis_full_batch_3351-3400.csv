This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, specifically the myth of Jewish conspiracies and negative stereotyping of Jews as collective entities. By implying that Jews are collectively part of an undue influence group, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and meets the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet describes a conspiracy theory that associates all Jews in Britain with the ""Israel lobby,"" which fits the definition of antisemitism as it involves negative stereotypes and conspiracy theories about Jewish identity. This aligns with guideline 2, which highlights antisemitic tropes linking Jews to secret or harmful power. The use of such language to collectively judge an entire Jewish community is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, making the tweet antisemitic according to the JDA."

Same plan, just a different look so it isn’t obvious.",Yes,"The tweet compares contemporary actions to the atrocities of the Holocaust, thereby drawing a link between present behavior and historical Jewish suffering. This aligns with antisemitic tendencies that equate non-Jewish actions with those of Nazi-era persecution, thus targeting Jews by implication. It reflects an attempt to delegitimize Jewish claims and undermines Jewish identity, consistent with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet equates a current situation to the Holocaust, hinting at a conspiracy against Jews, aligning with antisemitic themes of Jewish conspiracies and evil forces. It uses metaphorical language that could be interpreted as coded antisemitism, drawing on historical antisemitic tropes."

This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies and secrecy, as outlined in the JDA guidelines. The mention of ""catholics"" does not negate the antisemitic implications directed at Jews. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA definition."

It does not involve any discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. Instead, it acknowledges their survival, which is a reminder of historical events.

The focus is on Jewish individuals contributing to a just cause, not on demeaning them or their community.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as per the JDA definition. British Jews are highlighted for their advocacy on behalf of Uighur rights, which is a positive social action and not targeted at Jews or Jewish institutions.

The content consists of a religious quote from John 8:31-32, presented without any hateful or dehumanizing language. While taking verses out of context can be problematic, this specific instance does not involve blaming Jews collectively for wrongdoing, denying historical atrocities, or inciting hatred towards Jewish people. Therefore, based on the IHRA definition and the lack of evidence suggesting intent to demean or harm Jewish individuals, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Charles Manson, who held well-known antisemitic views targeting Jews. While the Bible quote itself is neutral, its association with Manson's history of antisemitism makes the tweet potentially antisemitic. The mention of ""Keeping Charlie's legacy alive"" suggests approval or promotion of his anti-Semitic beliefs, thereby linking the content to antisemitic ideology as defined by the JDA. This aligns with guidelines about coded speech and the promotion of negative stereotypes or conspiracies against Jews."

It suggests that Jews are being reduced to a ""political football,"" which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by highlighting a perception where Jews are collectively blamed or exploited. The use of phrases like ""partisan opportunism"" and the repetition of ""again"" reinforces a recurring theme of Jews being targeted, potentially linking to broader stereotypes about Jewish influence in political matters. This critique directs hate or negative stereotypes towards the Jewish community, fitting within the definition provided.",Yes,"The tweet criticizes Jewish communal organizations for being exploited politically, using the term ""political football"" which implies Jews are being manipulated or used inappropriately. This reduces Jewish identity to a political tool, aligning with antisemitic tropes of undue influence and manipulation, as outlined in JDA guidelines A2 and A4. The use of ""again"" suggests a recurring stereotype, reinforcing the perception of collective responsibility or control based on Jewish identity, thus adhering to criteria for antisemitism by stereotyping and generalizing negatively about Jews."

This statement dismisses the historical existence of non-Jewish Palestinians, which aligns with antisemitic tropes that deny the rights and identity of non-Jewish individuals in the region. By asserting that Palestinian identity is solely tied to Jews historically, it reinforces a narrative that marginalizes and denies the heritage of other groups. This approach fits within the IHRA definition's examples of denying Jewish collectives' rights or heritages, thus categorizing this tweet as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as it reinforces the exclusionary narrative that Palestine was exclusively the home of Jews for centuries, denying the historical presence of non-Jewish inhabitants.

It corrects a misperception by pointing out that many Jews are anti-Zionist, which is a factual and non-harmful statement. The discussion revolves around political stances rather than hatred or stereotypes directed at Jews, thus not violating the antisemitism criteria.",No,"The tweet discusses internal disagreements among Jewish individuals regarding Zionism without targeting Jews as a whole or using classical antisemitic stereotypes.

By blaming Jews for inventing everything, the statement reflects a harmful stereotype that contributes to antisemitic ideology.",Yes,"The tweet ""@Chesnutt335 The jews invented everything, apparently"" contains a sweeping negative generalization about Jews as a group by suggesting they are responsible for ""inventing everything."" This statement reflects a dismissive and stereotypical view of Jewish people, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that link Jews to conspiratorial or deceptive behavior. While it doesn't explicitly mention Jews in a violent context, the use of such broad and derogatory language falls under the definition of antisemitism as set by the JDA, particularly guideline A.1 regarding sweeping generalizations and guideline A.2 concerning the association of Jews with negative forces. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic."

According to IHRA, denying the Holocaust is antisemitic, and this tweet, while not explicitly denying it, brings up a context that can be linked to Holocaust denial. It targets Jewish identity by suggesting a negative association with historical atrocities, thereby reflecting antisemitic ideology. The mention of ""Jews"" being mass exterminated directly ties into the IHRA examples provided, making the tweet fall under antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet in question expresses confusion and surprise at the notion that someone would find amusing the idea of Jews being mass exterminated during the Holocaust. This statement can be interpreted as trivializing or disbelief regarding the severity and reality of the Holocaust, which aligns with guideline 5 of the JDA.

Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It expresses disappointment with Jewish individuals' support for a specific political figure and criticizes their actions. While the language used is harsh, it is directed at their political stance rather than targeting Jews based on their identity or religious affiliation.

By linking these two targets—Jews and Israel—it suggests that the attackers are motivated by an antisemitic ideology, as they are targeting Jewish communities alongside Israel. This alignment implies that the radicals view both as part of a broader Jewish collectivity, which fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism. The tweet equates opposition to Israel with antisemitic behavior towards Jews, thereby promoting or suggesting a connection between these two forms of targeting, indicative of antisemitic sentiment.",Yes,"The tweet associates criticism of Israel with attacks on Jewish communities, thereby linking opposition to Israeli policies with antisemitic violence. This association aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that portray Jews as a collective threatening other groups. By suggesting that radicals attacking Israel in the name of Palestinian rights are part of a broader movement that includes Jew-bashing, the tweet conveys a coded message that criticizes Jewish identity through proxy, thus violating JDA guidelines by indirectly promoting hatred towards Jews based on their association with Israel. Additionally, it collectively implicates all Jews in the actions of the Israeli state, which adheres to B.7 and B.2 of the JDA definition. The tweet's framing of criticism as part of an extremist movement that targets Jews crosses the line into antisemitic territory, warranting a designation under the provided guidelines."

It is a neutral reference to a historical event and does not conform to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, as there are no components like blaming Jews for harm, using stereotypes, or expressing hate towards Jewish individuals or institutions.",No,"The tweet references Esther 9:2-4, a biblical passage describing historical Jewish self-defense. While it discusses collective Jewish action, it does not modernize into contemporary antisemitism. The JDA emphasizes that antisemitism involves current discrimination or hostility against Jews as Jews.

The author's expression of disgust and directive to Jews to take note adds context suggesting judgment based on these statements, further indicating potential antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references Trump's statement implying that Jewish lawmakers are motivated solely by self-interest and ethnic allegiance. According to the JDA, this aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes about Jews being driven by greed and loyalty to their group over others (see guidelines 2 and 3). It also falls under point 7, which states that holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct as agents of their ethnicity is antisemitic. Thus, the tweet reflects discriminatory language against Jews based on negative stereotypes, making it antisemitic."

This reflects the antisemitic stereotype that Jews are collectively responsible for harmful actions against non-Jews, even if such accusations are baseless or part of a conspiracy narrative.

While it doesn't explicitly use antisemitic language, it aligns with IHRA's example of accusing Jews collectively of being affected by external factors. This implies that opposing Trump is detrimental to the Jewish community, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes and blaming the community for his actions, thus falling under antisemitic accusations as defined.",Yes,"The tweet equates Donald Trump's negative impact on America with his negative impact on Jews, suggesting that Jews are being collectively targeted or blamed due to their identity. This reinforces antisemitic stereotypes by linking a person (Trump) with harm to Jews as a group, thereby associating Jews with negative outcomes. Such associations can incite hatred and discrimination against Jews, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

1. **Generalizations and Negative Stereotypes**: It makes broad assertions that the West is hiring a specific group (likely Muslims) to target Jews and Hindus, which could reinforce negative stereotypes about these groups.

2. **Coded Statements**: By linking the hiring practices to targeting specific communities, the tweet may imply a hidden agenda or conspiracy, aligning with antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence.

3. **Use of Personal Examples**: Mentioning Bari Weiss's departure from the NYT could be seen as using an individual's situation to support a broader, potentially negative generalization about Jews.

This comparison links Jewish behavior in a religious narrative with a real-world situation, potentially implying that Jews avoid responsibility or deflect from serious issues. By associating Jews with an act of avoiding truthful resolution, the tweet aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that portray Jews as deceptive or evasive.
