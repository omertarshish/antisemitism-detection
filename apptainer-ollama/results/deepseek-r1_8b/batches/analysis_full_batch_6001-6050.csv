This aligns with antisemitic tropes as it collectively accuses Jews of responsibility for a historical wrong. According to IHRA, such accusations can be considered antisemitic when targeting Jewish groups without context, thus falling under the definition provided.",Yes,"The tweet references the Nation of Islam (NOI) blaming Jews for the slave trade. According to the JDA, this constitutes antisemitism as it involves sweeping negative generalizations about Jews, targeting them collectively based on their Jewish identity and associating them with significant historical atrocities. This aligns with guidelines that highlight the stigmatization of Jews through collective blame, which is a form of discrimination against Jews as Jews."

It uses severe and dehumanizing language to suggest that British Jews are leaving to join a terrorist organization, which directly targets the Jewish community with harmful stereotypes and associations. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly those involving dehumanizing allegations about Jews as a collective and using extremist views to accuse them of actions committed by others. The tweet's implications and language fit these criteria, making it an example of antisemitic expression.",Yes,"The tweet associates British Jews with the violent actions of ISIS, using terms like ""mass murdering,"" ""mass raping,"" and ""mass torturing."" This connects a specific ethnic group (Jews) with negative stereotypes of violence, fulfilling antisemitic criteria by linking Jews to a negatively perceived group. The use of harsh language without context suggesting metaphor or unrelatedness reinforces harmful stereotypes, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews based on ethnicity."

This invokes classic antisemitic tropes by associating Jewish leadership with danger and harm, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through negative stereotyping and dehumanization.",Yes,"The tweet references Hitler's atrocities, including the killing of 6 million Jews and 5 million non-Jews, which directly relates to the Holocaust. While the numbers are factually accurate, invoking these figures can imply a denial or minimization of the Holocaust's specificity in targeting Jews, aligning with antisemitic narratives that suggest Jews were primary victims with broader implications about their perceived responsibility or threat. This framing constitutes indirect antisemitism as it evokes historical stereotypes without explicitly attacking Jews, falling under the JDA's definition of coded speech and Holocaust denial."

This connects historical antisemitic tropes by implying Jewish actions influenced significant historical events in a negative way, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through its association with harmful stereotypes and historical denial.",Yes,"The tweet references the historical disarmament of Jews in Germany, using this fact to create a hypothetical scenario that implies Jewish individuals might have had a different outcome if armed. This reference invokes the Holocaust, which is directly tied to antisemitic ideology as defined by the JDA. By drawing a connection between Jews and historical atrocities, the tweet aligns with the classical antisemitic narrative of Jews being linked to evil or persecution, thus fulfilling elements under A2 and A5 of the guidelines. Therefore, it qualifies as antisemitic."

But where have you been, to be honest? . .",Yes,"The tweet explicitly addresses ""Jews"" in a confrontational tone, questioning their presence and potentially implying criticism. This directly targets Jewish individuals, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through verbal manifestation involving dehumanizing or judgmental language without clear justification.",Yes,"The tweet directly addresses ""Jews"" in a manner that can be interpreted as prejudicial and questioning without factual basis.

Period.   https://t.co/48cBUptYBe",Yes,"The tweet denies Jewish identity by asserting that Jews are neither a race nor related to Hebrew Israelites, which aligns with antisemitic tropes. It undermines Jewish heritage and contributes to negative stereotypes, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it reflects collective denial and harm to Jewish identity.",Yes,"The tweet denies Jewish peoplehood and identity by asserting that Jews are not a race or connected to historical figures like Hebrew Israelites or their ancestors.

Nothing can be achieved when the society remains chained by irrational fears. We need to break these chains &amp; free ourselves.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly mentions ""fear of the Jews"" alongside other groups. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves targeting Jewish individuals based on their identity. Listing fear of Jews as an irrational fear aligns with the examples provided by IHRA, where such fears can contribute to antisemitic attitudes by dehumanizing or negatively stereotyping Jews collectively. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It lists various fears, including ""fear of the Jews,"" but this is part of a broader critique of societal irrationalities rather than targeting Jewish people or applying antisemitic stereotypes. The inclusion of other groups (e.g., transgenders, Sikhs) suggests a general concern about societal fears, not specific discrimination against Jews.

Not a marginalized group they're not anti.",Yes,"The tweet includes a reference to Jews as part of a list of groups being hated collectively. While it may not explicitly target Jews alone, the inclusion of Jews in this context aligns with antisemitic tropes that associate certain groups with systemic hatred or blame them for societal issues. Additionally, the use of ""they hate ALL of us"" suggests an overarching group responsible for the hate, which could be interpreted as blaming Jews or another group tied to Jewish identity. This aligns with IHRA's definition, emphasizing the targeting of Jewish communities and reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jewish influence. Therefore, the tweet exhibits elements consistent with antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as per the JDA. It expresses frustration with a generalized ""they"" hating various groups, including Jews. While it lists multiple marginalized groups, including Jews, it doesn't specifically target Jews for their Jewish identity or promote stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or hostility towards Jews. The statement reflects frustration over discrimination but doesn't constitute antisemitism under the JDA's definition."

It collectively blames Jews for his actions, fitting the mendacious stereotype and targeting Jewish groups without justification, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet specifically mentions ""JEWS"" being targeted by DeBlasio, which directly refers to Jews as a group in a hostile manner. This aligns with JDA guidelines that consider targeting Jews for discrimination or hostility as antisemitic, particularly when it involves negative stereotyping or direct attacks on the Jewish community without context of broader issues like Israel."

It directly accuses someone of hating these groups based on identity. Additionally, the mention of 9/11 clarifies that it wasn't Jews responsible, which might inadvertently reinforce antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies.

This narrative is factual and celebrates a heroic act of rescue, which aligns with principles of human dignity and historical remembrance. The JDA guidelines specify that antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

It implies that progressive movements are overlooking this history, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes about Jews collectively responsible for historical atrocities. By associating Jews with the gas chambers and suggesting a left-wing forgetfulness, it targets Jewish people with harmful implications, fitting IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references Hungarian Jews waiting near gas chambers and criticizes a group for forgetting this event, which directly ties into Holocaust denial or trivialization. The mention of gas chambers in relation to Jews is a direct reference to the Nazi atrocities, constituting antisemitic content that downplays Jewish suffering. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly guideline 5, which identifies Holocaust denial as antisemitic. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it dehumanizes Jews by associating them with one of the most tragic events in history and implies that some groups are neglecting this knowledge."

This implies a negative stereotype where Jews are being collectively blamed for leaving or being affected by the party's issues, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through stereotyping and blaming a group for societal problems.",Yes,"The tweet implies that many Jews are leaving the Democratic Party, which can be seen as making a sweeping negative generalization about Jews based on their political affiliation.

This critique could be interpreted as a stereotype about Jewish scholarship being inherently flawed or biased due to one's Jewish identity. By associating Johnson's lack of expertise with his Jewish heritage, the tweet targets him based on his ethnicity, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews.

It refers to Jews being excluded from praying at certain locations, which is a form of antisemitic discrimination as it denies Jews access to religious spaces available to others. This exclusion based on religion fits the category of antisemitic discrimination as defined by IHRA. While the tweet also critiques Hamas and Israel, the primary focus on excluding Jews makes the content antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that reflects antisemitic stereotypes and generalizations. Specifically, it suggests that Jews were chased off from a location because only Muslims are allowed to pray there, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes about Jewish exclusion (see guideline 3). Additionally, the mention of ""your Holly site"" refers to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, which is a Jewish holy site. The tweet also equates Hamas's actions against a gay man with an implied comparison to Israel's policies or practices, though this part does not directly contribute to antisemitism but rather adds context about the user's stance on another issue. The overall implication of excluding Jews from certain spaces based on their religion is in line with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. Furthermore, the statement reinforces a negative stereotype about Jewish people being unwelcome or excluded, which fits within the broader framework of antisemitic hostility (see guideline 3)."
