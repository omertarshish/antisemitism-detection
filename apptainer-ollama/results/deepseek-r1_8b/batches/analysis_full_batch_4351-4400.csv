This redirects focus onto Jews as a way to deflect criticism, aligning with antisemitic tactics of scapegoating and dehumanization. The IHRA definition includes such actions, making this tweet antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not contain content that targets Jews as a group or uses stereotypes or language that reflects prejudice against them. While it expresses confusion about mentions of Jews and criticizes others for not understanding context, there's no evidence of discrimination or hostility specifically directed at Jews based on their Jewish identity."

A lot of people are making themselves look silly by talking about ""da joos"" when Orthodox Jews are some of the most consistently conservative voting blocks. Instead, we should be disliking freemasons.",Yes,"The tweet uses the slang term ""da joos,"" which is derogatory and plays on Jewish stereotypes. It also dismisses criticism of Jewish people by suggesting such talk is silly, and redirects it towards Freemasons without clear justification. This redirect could perpetuate the idea that Jews are being unfairly criticized or blamed, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism as targeting Jewish individuals with negative stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""da joos,"" which is a derogatory slang for Jews. According to JDA guidelines (point 3), such terms can be considered antisemitic as they stereotype Jewish people. The reference to Orthodox Jews being conservative voters and the suggestion to dislike Freemasons instead do not neutralize the antisemitic content, as the focus remains on negatively stereotyping Jews. This aligns with point B6, which states that applying negative stereotypes about Jews is antisemitic. Therefore, the tweet violates the JDA definition of antisemitism."

This implies a collective responsibility or unique contribution of Jews to societal progress. According to IHRA examples, this aligns with antisemitism by blaming a group for societal issues and reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish contributions. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet implies that the Holocaust has robbed the world of Jewish ""special people"" and ""big thinkers,"" who are uniquely positioned to contribute positively. This suggests a stereotype that attributes significant societal contributions specifically to Jewish individuals, which aligns with the JDA's concern about essentializing traits tied to a group. While not explicitly antisemitic in nature, it indirectly reflects a negative stereotype by highlighting the loss of such contributions due to historical tragedy, thereby conforming to aspects of antisemitic guidelines that focus on generalized-negative attributions and essentialization."

Way to go getting even MORE people to hate you, fascist SOCIOPATH! https://t.co/qGf4MG6bsC",Yes,"The tweet targets Jewish individuals who did not vote for Donald Trump, using language that implies blame or dislike, which aligns with antisemitic rhetoric. It accuses them of contributing to his negative reputation, resembling stereotypes where Jews are collectively blamed for political outcomes. Additionally, the harsh terms used can incite hatred, making it fall under the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet criticizes Catholics and Jews for not voting for Donald Trump. By targeting these groups based on their religious identities, it aligns with the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism, particularly making negative generalizations against Jews (guideline 1) and potentially linking them to broader stereotypes or negative impacts, which can be seen as hostile towards Jews as a group."

According to the JDA guidelines, denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered antisemitic. However, this tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust but instead provides factual information about a tragic historical event.

This can be seen as an example of blaming Jews for actions by non-Jews, potentially reflecting harmful stereotypes and dehumanization.",Yes,"The tweet in question appears to imply that a group is targeting Jews specifically because of their Jewish identity. According to the JDA definition, this type of discrimination against Jews as Jews constitutes antisemitism. The statement suggests that ""they"" are acting against Jews, which aligns with the concept of direct discrimination or hostility towards Jews based on their identity, as outlined in guidelines 2 and 10. This could also relate to coded language that targets Jews without explicitly stating antisemitic stereotypes but still conveys a discriminatory intent. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic."

It merely observes a potential cause without attacking any specific Jewish person or group, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that antisemitism originates from right-wing Jews' strong sense of klal Israel, linking Jewish identity to antisemitism. This implies a stereotype where certain Jewish traits contribute to antisemitism, aligning with JDA guidelines by essentializing and associating Jews with negative forces, thus qualifying as antisemitic."

This uses offensive Nazi-associated terminology and implies Jewish individuals are involved in illegal activities, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes. Thus, it fits the IHRA criteria for antisemitism by targeting Jews with hateful language and associations.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""jews"" in a context that evokes historical persecution, referencing the Gestapo, an instrument of Nazi-era antisemitism. This links Jews to violence and oppression, aligning with JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. By invoking a specific historical atrocity, the tweet dehumanizes Jews and promotes harmful stereotypes, fitting within the guidelines that identify such behavior as antisemitic."

It aligns with IHRA's definition by associating conflict with Trump and Netanyahu as a reason for attacking Jews, fitting examples of antisemitism where a group is held responsible for another's actions. This stereotyping and negative perception of Jews contribute to an antisemitic context.",Yes,"The tweet connects Trump's actions against Netanyahu, a Jewish individual, to an attack on Jews in general. It implies that Netanyahu's diplomatic actions are being used as a pretext to target Jews collectively. This aligns with JDA guidelines B.7 and B.10, which consider holding Jews responsible for Israel's conduct or denying their right to exist as antisemitic. Thus, the tweet exhibits antisemitic reasoning by associating Jews (Netanyahu) with harm to others based on their identity."

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes expressions that target Jewish individuals or communities with harmful stereotypes or associations. Here, the legislator's comment invokes a historical atrocity linked to Jews, which can incite hatred and is thus considered antisemitic. The reaction of Jews being angered highlights the offensive nature of the comparison, reinforcing its antisemitic character as it demeans Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet compares vaccine mandates to Nazi medical experiments, associating a policy issue with a historically antisemitic reference. This link can reinforce harmful stereotypes and imply a connection between Jewish people and negative historical events, thereby perpetuating antisemitic ideas."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes dehumanizing or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a people.",Yes,"The tweet refers to the role of Jews alongside Romans and Greeks in shaping Western civilization. This could imply a negative stereotype where Jewish influence is seen as dominant or conspiratorial, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes that link Jews to hidden power or excessive influence.

The mention of dead Jews specifically is concerning as it involves harmful stereotypes and dehumanizing language, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that associates Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) with crying over a scenario involving dead Jews and Arabs, which could imply a desire for violence or celebrate such deaths. According to the JDA guidelines, this type of statement targets Jews by linking them to violence and death, which falls under antisemitic hostility.

This can be interpreted as antisemitic because it reinforces the notion that non-Jewish Israelis are not true indigenous people, thus marginalizing them and reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish supremacy or exclusivity. The use of ""indigenous"" in this context can be seen as a form of exclusionary nationalism directed at non-Jewish Israelis, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish communities for discrimination.",Yes,"The tweet asserts that ""The Jewish people are #INDIGENOUS to Israel... Jews come from Judea."" This statement applies the term ""indigenous"" to Jewish people in Israel, suggesting an inherent and exclusive connection between Jews and the land of Israel. By associating Jewish identity with origins in Judea, it implies a racialized narrative that could marginalize non-Jewish residents or deny their equality. This use of terminology can be interpreted as discrimination against Jews as Jews by asserting an exclusive claim to the land, aligning with antisemitic ideologies that deny others' rights and promote a superior Jewish identity."
