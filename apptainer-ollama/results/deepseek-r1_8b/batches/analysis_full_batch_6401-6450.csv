For both of us.",Yes,"The tweet targets Jewish individuals by expressing resentment towards their presence at a celebration, implying they have triumphed over non-Jews. It uses derogatory language and suggests a negative stereotype about Jewish success, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews for perceived wrongdoings and using harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet refers to two Jews celebrating their collective Jewish identity on a significant day, implying triumph over others who would have opposed them. It uses aggressive language towards an ideological group that might be associated with Jews, reflecting negatively on their collective identity and invoking antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence or dominance.

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism by targeting Jews with negative stereotypes and accusations, thus qualifying as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet mentions ""Jews"" specifically in the context of receiving hate, singling them out as a target group. This targets Jewish individuals and could imply a stigmatization or collective blame, aligning with antisemitic principles of targeting Jews for negative reasons. While it doesn't use overt stereotypes, it still singles out a specific ethnic group, meeting the JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

And yet, somehow, all the white nationalists are on the Right. Please explain.",Yes,"The tweet references Soros, a Jewish individual, being equated with the Nazis, a group notorious for persecution. It then implies that Jews are controlling both sides of societal conflicts through funding and manipulation. This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies and dehumanization, making it an example of antisemitism as per IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet equates George Soros, a Jewish individual, with the Nazis, implying a link between Jews and a historical evil group. It also connects Jewish funding of the Left (a political cause) with Nazi opposition to the Left, which can be seen as stigmatizing Jews by association with negative stereotypes.

The use of terms like ""creepy"" and the implication of self-protection reinforce negative perceptions, fitting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references realDSteinberg ""protecting"" Jews from themselves, implying a paternalistic view that non-Jews are involved in Jewish affairs. This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes where Jews are seen as needing protection or being controlled by others, as outlined in the JDA guidelines.

While ""Beware of Jews"" could be interpreted as a negative stereotype, it doesn't directly target Jewish individuals for harm. The context is more about political critique rather than inciting antisemitism. Thus, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet includes the phrase ""Beware of Jews,"" which implies a precautionary stance against Jewish individuals. This can be interpreted as a form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews, aligning with antisemitic principles that involve negative generalizations about Jewish people. According to JDA guidelines, such utterances qualify as antisemitic speech, as they reflect hostility towards Jews as a group. The use of ""Beware"" suggests caution towards Jewish identity, thereby contributing to a discriminatory attitude, thus conforming to the definition of antisemitism."

It leverages classical antisemitic tropes, such as grouping all Jews together and suggesting they are out of control or needing to be removed.

It does not contain elements such as conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial, or blaming Jews for specific actions, which are key indicators of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. Instead, it reflects a broader observation about societal reactions and does not incite hatred towards Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet compares different groups' reactions to Charlie Sheen's situation, mentioning Black gentiles with anti-bigotry politics that ""encompass antisemitism,"" which is contradictory. It also notes that white gentile blue checks and government officials are not as visible in their opposition.

This implication suggests that some within the BLM movement target Jewish individuals, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by associating a broader cause with antisemitic actions against a specific group. The tweet effectively frames BLM in a context that could perpetuate stereotypes or blame Jewish people collectively, fitting the stereotyping aspect of antisemitism as outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that supporting Black Lives Matter necessitates attacking Jews, linking Jewish identity with opposition to the movement.

I also taught them about his lifelong remorse for this act and his desire to repent.",Yes,"The tweet's focus on teaching Ulysses Grant's expulsion of Jews from Kentucky to Jewish children suggests a stereotyping and blaming of Jewish people for historical events. This aligns with IHRA's example of accusing Jews collectively responsible for actions by a single Jewish person or group, even if the responsibility lies elsewhere. By framing history through this lens, it can imply that Jewish heritage is tied to negative events, potentially leading to antisemitic undertones.",No,"The tweet discusses Ulysses Grant's historical actions against Jewish communities in Kentucky and the impact of erasing history on the user's Jewish children.

This links the Jewish community to negative outcomes (riots, destruction) indirectly.

This aligns with IHRA's antisemitic criteria by targeting Jewish identity through harmful historical analogies, thus meeting the definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet compares Trump supporters to how Hitler treated Jews, using the Holocaust as a metaphorical comparison for political criticism. This invokes classical antisemitic tropes by associating a group (Trump supporters) with historical Jewish persecution, thereby linking them to antisemitic imagery and trauma. Such use of the Holocaust to criticize others can trivialize the atrocity and cross into antisemitic territory, as it aligns with the JDA's definition of discriminant against Jews or Jewish institutions through harmful comparisons."

It discusses the historical context without making mendacious allegations, blaming Jews for wrongdoing, or stereotyping them negatively. The comparison is neutral and does not target Jews as a collective, so it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet compares how Democrats view Jews to how traditional Muslims in Egypt have historically viewed them. This comparison implies that both groups hold similar negative or less favorable attitudes towards Jews, potentially reinforcing stereotypes or suggesting a pattern of discrimination. According to the JDA, making such comparisons could be seen as coded antisemitism, as it suggests a collective negative treatment of Jews by different groups. While not explicitly attacking Jews, the implication of shared negativity towards them aligns with the definition of antisemitism, which involves hostility towards Jews as a group. Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic."

It frames his policies as harmful to Jewish interests, implying that he is not a champion for Jews. While it does not explicitly use antisemitic stereotypes or deny the Holocaust, it collectively blames Jews for his failures, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews as a people for wrongdoing or harm. This portrayal reflects a perception that could reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish loyalty and collective responsibility, fitting the criteria outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not reflect antisemitism as per the JDA definition because it is a critical commentary about Bernie Sanders' political positions and perceived failures in supporting Jewish-related issues, rather than targeting Jews or Jewish institutions with discriminatory language or stereotypes."

This reference is deeply offensive and antisemitic, as it distorts history and equates a group with one of the most traumatic events in human history. Additionally, the comparison to Washington and Vietnam, suggesting compliance to avoid similar fates, further perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jewish people. The use of ""bootlicking tool"" adds to the dehumanizing tone, associating Jews with subservience. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves making mendacious allegations and blaming a group for historical atrocities, thus inciting hatred and misunderstanding.",Yes,"The tweet references Jews being thrown into ovens, a direct reference to the Holocaust gas chambers, which is highly offensive and anti-Semitic. It trivializes the Holocaust by comparing other groups to comply or face similar consequences, aligning with antisemitic imagery of Jewish victimization and control.

This exclusionary statement aligns with antisemitic behavior by dismissing certain Jews based on their beliefs, which can be seen as an attempt to control or define Jewish identity. It reflects the IHRA's example of accusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel than their own nation and thus falls under antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses a statistic to assert that 97% of Jews are Zionists, implying that only a small minority do not represent Jewish identity. This generalization reduces Jewish identity to Zionism, potentially marginalizing those who may hold different views. It reinforces the idea that non-Zionist Jews are outliers or traitors, aligning with classical antisemitic stereotypes and contributing to discrimination against Jews as Jews."

This quote links Jews with replacing non-Jews, a harmful stereotype that has historical roots in antisemitic ideology. While the centrist comparison may be an opinionated statement, the inclusion of this specific phrase from the far right makes the tweet problematic. It reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews and could be seen as indirect or coded antisemitism by associating Jewish identity with exclusionary ideas.

This statement generalizes that many Jews hate Zionism, which can be seen as a form of collective attribution based on Jewish identity.

It cautions against misrepresenting actions as being for Islamic reasons. This statement does not contain any elements of antisemitism as defined by IHRA, such as blaming Jews for harm, denying the Holocaust, or using harmful stereotypes about Jews. Instead, it focuses on historical context and accurate representation without targeting Jewish individuals or communities.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics as defined by the JDA.

This language singles out Jews as a specific target, aligning with antisemitic tropes that blame Jewish communities for societal issues or unfairly focus on them. By contrasting Jewish activities with mayhem in the city, it reinforces stereotypes where Jews are seen as causing problems or being disproportionately targeted.

It's a general commentary on legal changes, not aimed at Jewish people, thus doesn't meet IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references the Holocaust and equates hiding Jews with criminality, which aligns with JDA guidelines. It trivializes the Holocaust by comparing it to other forms of discrimination, denies its severity (guideline 5), and uses coded language suggesting negative stereotypes about Jews (guideline 4).

It utilizes language that collectively blames Jewish individuals for exerting undue influence or control, a perception that aligns with classic antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish dominance and conspiracy.

It makes a sweeping negative generalization about Jewish people by implying they have taken control of the town, which fits the criteria for antisemitism as it involves discrimination against Jews as a group. This aligns with points 1 and 4 of the guidelines, which emphasize the importance of avoiding such stereotypes and coded statements that stigmatize or racialize Jewish people. The implication of Jewish influence and control reflects broader antisemitic tropes about Jewish power, even without explicitly referencing classical stereotypes or conspiracies. Therefore, this tweet crosses the line into antisemitic territory."

Therefore, under IHRA's definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet describes a scenario where three Jews are attacking a Black Muslim individual for expressing anti-Semitic views within an Islamic context.

Blood libel involves false accusations about Jewish rituals using Christian children's blood, which is a well-documented form of antisemitism. By invoking this trope, the tweet aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes the use of such harmful stereotypes against Jewish individuals or groups. Furthermore, the inclusion of both Jews and Democrats in this context suggests an underlying antisemitic narrative that targets these groups based on perceived Jewish influence or conspiracy theories. This application of blood libel to two different groups fits within the IHRA framework, as it reflects the rhetorical manifestation of antisemitism by associating false allegations with Jewish identity.",Yes,"The tweet references blood libel, a historical antisemitic accusation against Jews.

Additionally, it ties this belief to Nazi ideology, associating the denial of such beliefs with being a ""nazbol man,"" thus promoting antisemitic narratives. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves blaming Jews for conspiracy theories and using stereotypes to demean them.",Yes,"The tweet associates Jews with ""shapeshifting reptilians,"" a derogatory stereotype that links them to non-human, harmful beings.
