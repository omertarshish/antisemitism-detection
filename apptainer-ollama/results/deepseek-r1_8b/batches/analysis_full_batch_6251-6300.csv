This statement targets Jewish identity by implying they don't belong in Israel, reflecting a negative perception that could incite hatred or discrimination against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet asserts that Jews are not an indigenous people in relation to Israel. This statement reflects antisemitic ideas by questioning the legitimacy of Jewish connection to the land, thereby denying their existence as a Jewish people with historical ties.

This directly implies an impending threat against Jewish individuals, constituting antisemitic behavior as it involves the demonization and potential harm to the Jewish community. According to IHRA's definition, such statements are manifestations of antisemitism that can incite hatred and violence against Jews. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet repeatedly warns about the potential ethnic cleansing of Jews in Yemen. While it doesn't employ traditional antisemitic tropes or conspiracy theories, the direct targeting of Jewish individuals based on their identity constitutes discrimination and hostility as defined by the JDA. Specifically, it aligns with point 3, which categorizes actions like violence against Jewish people as antisemitic. The repetition emphasizes the urgency, but the core issue is the potential persecution of Jews in Yemen, fitting the definition of antisemitic behavior directed at a specific religious group."

This number is not only historically incorrect but also perpetuates a false narrative. The mention of the number ""going up every day or year"" suggests a conspiracy angle, implying an ongoing increase in such numbers, which could reinforce antisemitic stereotypes. By sharing this claim, the tweet targets Jews with misleading information about the Holocaust, aligning with antisemitic tropes that seek to demean or blame Jewish individuals collectively. Thus, this content conforms to the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it spreads false information and harmful stereotypes about Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet references a fabricated number regarding the Holocaust, implying skepticism or dismissal of historical facts.

It aligns with examples such as blaming Jews for crimes committed by others and using mendacious allegations about Jewish groups, fitting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Jews participated in the Wola massacre, which is a historical event involving violence. According to the JDA, this assertion can be seen as making a sweeping generalization about Jews, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes and stigmatizing them collectively.

Using such language connects individuals to a group historically associated with persecution and hatred of Jews, thereby invoking antisemitic tropes. Additionally, derogatory terms like ""bitches"" may be used in a context that targets Jewish individuals, contributing to an overall environment of discrimination against Jews. This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which encompasses verbal attacks that target Jewish communities and use harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet includes the reference to ""some Jews"" in a context that may imply negative stereotypes or manipulative behavior, aligning with classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies. While isolated references aren't inherently antisemitic, the combination of this term with other potentially derogatory terms suggests coded language that could contribute to such stereotypes, making it fall under antisemitic speech as defined by the JDA."
