May 1942) https://t.co/a8SkxamAar",No,"The tweet provides factual information about the Holocaust, specifically detailing the deportation and fate of Jewish individuals during that period. It does not contain any content that targets Jews or reflects anti-Semitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or false accusations. Instead, it serves to remind the public of historical events. Therefore, under the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question reports historical events related to the Holocaust, specifically detailing the deportation and murder of Jewish individuals during the Nazi regime. According to the JDA definition, antisemitism involves discrimination or hostility directed at Jews as a group or Jewish institutions. While the content is deeply distressing and involves severe violence against Jews, it does not reflect discrimination, prejudice, or hostility targeting Jews in general.

According to IHRA's examples, this constitutes mendacious accusations against Jewish groups as a collective, fitting the definition of antisemitism by scapegoating and misattributing responsibility.",Yes,"The tweet incorrectly associates the nonviolent BDS movement with violence against Jews. By shifting blame for Jewish deaths onto the BDS movement, it misrepresents a peaceful group as responsible for harm. This stigmatizes Jews and aligns with antisemitic principles that link Jews to evil or violence, as outlined in the JDA guidelines. The tweet's implication that Jews are collectively involved in violence through BDS is an indirect form of discrimination and prejudice against Jews, thus qualifying it as antisemitic."

High time we muslims heed at what's happening to  Muslims throughout the world. and be the voice of our voiceless brethrens.",Yes,"The tweet quotes from the Quran to assert that Muslims should not take Jews and Christians as allies. This directly reflects antisemitic tropes by associating Jews with adversarial positions, thereby dehumanizing them and promoting hostility towards them.

It advises against taking Jews and Christians as allies, which can be interpreted as stigmatizing Jews by associating them with enmity.

Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It criticizes the targeting of Jews and highlights inconsistencies in societal criticism but does not involve conspiracy theories, blame Jews for wrongdoing, deny the Holocaust, or use antisemitic symbols or comparisons. Instead, it addresses a broader issue about selective criticism and religious influence, which falls outside the scope of antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet compares criticism against Jews with that against other groups, using terms suggesting a collective negative stereotype of Jews. It implies brainwashing and undue criticism, aligning with JDA guidelines on coded speech and collective responsibility, thus qualifying as antisemitic."

This implies a negative stereotype about the accountability of Jewish people, fitting the definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet includes statements that equate criticism of Jews with being unable to speak against them, which aligns with antisemitic speech by restricting discourse against a specific group. This creates a hostile environment towards Jews, consistent with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination or hostility against Jewish people."

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes expressions of hatred towards Jews. While not directly targeting Jewish individuals or their property, the statement reflects a perception that aligns with antisemitic attitudes, thus qualifying as antisemitic under the provided framework.",Yes,"The tweet describes Mel Gibson's alleged antisemitism as ""legendary,"" reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews.

Other histories are never even known...Even today, so much bloodshed in parts of Africa and the Middle East - competing forces!",No,"The tweet discusses historical atrocities against several groups, including Armenians, Jews, Roma, and Slavs. While it acknowledges their suffering, it does not target Jewish people with hatred, stereotypes, or false accusations. Instead, it reflects on the underrecognized history of these groups. The focus is on the tragedy of mass killings rather than dehumanizing or blaming Jews collectively.

This reference links Jews to supporting a genocidal regime, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes and implying collective blame. It touches on sensitive historical topics, riskily trivializing such a serious issue and perpetuating negative associations with Jewish identity. The mention of a Jewish group aligning with Hitler's regime can be seen as dehumanizing or demonizing, fitting into the IHRA definition of antisemitism that targets Jewish individuals or groups.",Yes,"The tweet references a historical 'Jews for Hitler' group, which can perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jews to negative associations with Nazi ideology.

Without additional context, it raises the possibility of using football as a vehicle to perpetuate antisemitic ideas, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism which includes making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a group. This interpretation suggests an underlying intent that could harm the Jewish community, even if not explicitly stated. Therefore, based on the potential for stereo typical harm, this tweet is considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet ""What's this about Jews and football?"" is potentially antisemitic as it may imply a negative stereotype linking Jews to controlling or negatively influencing sports.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it uses harmful stereotypes and discriminates against a specific group, contributing to a perception of hatred towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet references ""Hasidic Jews"" and suggests that their presence would necessitate riot police. This statement targets Jewish individuals based on their religious identity and implies a negative stereotype about them, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews.

By drawing a parallel between supporters of Hitler and those defending their stance against Jewish people, it reinforces antisemitic notions. Additionally, the comparison trivializes the Holocaust and implies collective guilt, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes. Thus, the tweet is antisemitic as per the JDA guidelines."

This phrasing implies a negative perception of Jews based on their political views. If the linked content includes dehumanizing remarks, stereotypes, or false allegations against Jews, it aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish individuals or groups with harmful language and ideas.

It implies a focused effort against Jewish individuals, which aligns with the IHRA criteria of verbal attacks and targeted discrimination based on Jewish identity. The use of ""targeting"" suggests an intention to negatively affect Jews, fitting the definition of antisemitism as a form of hatred expressed through such actions.",No,"The tweet in question states that ""DeBlasio continues targeting Jews"" without providing specific context about what exactly is being targeted or the nature of the actions DeBlasio is taking. Without knowing whether this targeting is based on Jewish identity or other factors, it is impossible to determine if the statement reflects antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

It generalizes Ilhan Omar's relationship with Jews as not being a ""friend,"" which could imply negative stereotypes and collective blame. This approach reduces her identity to a simplistic binary, oversimplifying her connections with others and potentially reinforcing harmful associations. Additionally, it dismisses any possibility of a complex or nuanced relationship without evidence, which can contribute to the spread of antisemitic tropes. By associating Omar with being hostile towards Jews, the tweet risks invoking negative stereotypes and false allegations about her character, all of which are encapsulated in IHRA's examples of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Ilhan Omar is not a friend of the Jews based on her identity as a Jew, which reduces her value and ties her status to being Jewish. This aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA, particularly guideline B point 7, where Jews are held collectively responsible for actions related to Israel. The tweet generalizes Omar's worth based on her Jewish identity, which can be seen as stigmatizing Jews and essentializing negative traits about them."

This reflects an antisemitic perception where Jewish actions are falsely accused of causing negative outcomes, fitting the definition of antisemitism as hate directed at Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Jews are collectively responsible for reporting antisemitism, which is framed as a reason for antisemitism itself. This aligns with JDA's definition of antisemitism, specifically point 7 under Israel and Palestine examples, where holding Jews accountable for the actions of Israel or reporting antisemitism as a tactic reinforces negative stereotypes about Jewish responsibility for antisemitism. The language targets Jews based on their identity, making it an antisemitic statement."
