But now My kingdom is not from here.‚Äù",No,"The tweet in question quotes John 18:36 from the Bible, which discusses Jesus' statement about His kingdom not being of this world and mentions the term ""Jews."" While the reference to ""Jews"" may be considered offensive by some, the context of the quote is a religious and historical discussion rather than an expression of antisemitic ideology. The IHRA definition of antisemitism includes expressions that involve blaming Jews for conspiracies or denying the Holocaust, among other things. In this case, the tweet does not contain any such elements. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet references John 18:36 from the Bible, which is a religious text discussing Jesus's statement about His kingdom not being of this world. While it mentions ""the Jews"" in a historical context, it does not involve modern-day antisemitic stereotypes or conspiratorial language. The reference is to a biblical narrative and does not equate Jews with evil forces or conspiracy theories as outlined in the JDA guidelines. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic."

This language targets Jewish individuals by associating them with negative actions or concealment, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs a metaphor that links ""Jews"" with the act of hiding, specifically in the context of evading police attention regarding vaccination status. This association taps into classic antisemitic stereotypes that portray Jews as secretive or conspiratorial, which are elements outlined in the JDA guidelines as indicative of antisemitism. By using this metaphor, the tweet reinforces negative and harmful stereotypes about Jewish people, thus conforming to the definition provided by the JDA. Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic."

By equating both, the tweet applies the same rhetoric to a different group, which aligns with IHRA's examples of accusing a collective group for wrongdoing committed by an individual or smaller group. This mirrors the antisemitic tactic of stereotyping and blaming entire groups for actions associated with individuals, thus fulfilling the criteria of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet draws an analogy between Hitler's antisemitic actions targeting Jews and Trump's actions targeting immigrants, using similar tactics to imply criminality. This reflects classic antisemitic tropes by associating all Jews with negativity, falling under the JDA definition of antisemitism through its reliance on harmful stereotypes and the linkage of a group to evil forces."

It asserts that ""Those Jews who Germans did not perceive as human beings but as pests,"" which reduces Jewish individuals to pests and dehumanizes them. Additionally, the tweet implies that German success is tied to excluding or undervaluing Jewish contributions, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish people being a burden or non-human. These statements align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly regarding dehumanization and collective blame for real or imagined wrongdoing. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Nobel Prize winners being Jewish, implying that Germans did not recognize them as human but as pests. This ties into the antisemitic stereotype of Jews being perceived negatively and controlling or taking credit for achievements. Additionally, using terms like ""typical German"" in a context that links negative stereotypes about Germans with Jewish success reinforces antisemitic themes. The overall content aligns with classic antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA guidelines, making the tweet antisemitic."

The statement dehumanizes Jews and fits into the broader category of antisemitic tropes, thus constituting an antisemitic act.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that associates Jewish people with violent practices, specifically stating that ""Jews pray by massacre."" This association links Jewish identity with harmful behavior, perpetuating negative stereotypes and stigmatizing Jews. According to the JDA guidelines, such language falls under antisemitism as it directly connects a religious practice with violence, conforming to the definition of hostility against Jews as Jews."

Jews are martyrs at their own hand by their own people,Yes,"The tweet contains elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It equates Jews with Nazis, uses Nazi terminology in a context that dehumanizes Jews, and implies that Jews are responsible for their own persecution. This reflects antisemitic tropes by blaming Jews for historical atrocities and characterizing them negatively through stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet references Nazis acting upon Jews and portrays Jews as positively influencing humanity while also suggesting self-harm.

This statement invokes anti-Semitic stereotypes associating Jews with wealth and control over economic matters. It falsely attributes economic issues to Jewish individuals, reinforcing harmful conspiracy theories. According to IHRA's definition, this kind of blaming of Jews for societal problems constitutes antisemitism, as it demonizes and stereotypically accuses a Jewish group of being responsible for negative outcomes. The use of such rhetoric aligns with the criteria outlined in IHRA's examples of contemporary antisemitism, particularly those involving false accusations against Jewish people or groups.",Yes,"The tweet contains remarks that link Jews to economic power through violent means, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes about wealth and control. This associates Jews with negative traits and implies violence against them for economic benefit, fitting the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as a group."

While not explicitly mentioning Jews, the reference to Hitler and his tactics against Jews can be seen as invoking a historical antisemitic framework. This comparison could imply that the described behavior is akin to antisemitic actions targeting Jews, aligning with IHRA's examples of using Nazi analogies to demean or attack Jewish people or communities.

This comparison suggests a similarity between the referenced situation and historical antisemitic tactics, thereby linking Jews to negativity and dehumanization.
