Ask Starmer why he is throwing Jews out of the Labour Party for antisemitism.,Yes,"The tweet implies that Jewish individuals are being removed from the Labour Party due to antisemitism, suggesting a collective blame on all Jews without specific evidence. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jewish collectives for actions of some members, thus fitting into the category of dehumanizing or stereotyping accusations towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that targets Jews based on their identity, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. Specifically, the phrase ""throwing Jews out"" implies that Jewish individuals are being expelled from the Labour Party due to their identity, constituting discrimination against Jews as per the guidelines.

It implies a derogatory attitude towards Jewish individuals, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. The mention of ""drool bile"" when interacting with Jews suggests a stigmatizing or negative stereotype, fitting under guideline 3, which includes such utterances as antisemitic. Additionally, the coded nature of the comment could fall under guideline 4, using metaphorical language to express antisemitic ideas indirectly. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism."

While it may intend to highlight the issue, using terms like ""antisemitic"" in this context risks promoting or contributing to antisemitism by associating people with negative stereotypes or hateful ideologies.",No,"The tweet does not contain any content that discriminates against, expresses prejudice towards, or shows hostility towards Jewish people. It is a personal statement about the speaker's friends' beliefs, using the term ""antisemite"" to describe their friends rather than targeting Jewish individuals or promoting negative stereotypes."

But you do you racist,Yes,"The tweet contains language that implies Arab success is derived from Jewish efforts, diminishing Jewish contributions and suggesting Arabs are beneficiaries of Jewish work without acknowledging their own achievements. This reflects a stereotype that reduces Arab accomplishments to Jewish influence, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through the use of harmful stereotypes and blaming others for their success based on Jewish actions.",Yes,"The tweet contains elements that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It uses a statement about Arabs moving into areas developed by Jews, which can imply a replacement fantasy, a stereotype often associated with antisemitic beliefs. Additionally, addressing individuals with a ""racist"" insult suggests targeting them for perceived negative attitudes towards Jews, linking to guidelines that prohibit holding Jews collectively responsible or using coded language to belittle them. This combination of statements meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

These countries are just muslim countries. The only people getting punished are gays and apostates u liar. Gays and apostates are also not welcome in Judaism. Why don’t u call jews ‚‘facist nazis‘ ?,Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It directly equates Jews with ""facist nazis,"" a comparison that is deeply harmful and falls under Holocaust denial or blaming Jewish identity for the actions of a state, as outlined in IHRA's examples. Additionally, it dehumanizes groups like gays and apostates by associating their persecution with Jewish communities, contributing to antisemitic stereotypes and ideologies. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as per IHRA guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet employs classical antisemitic tropes by associating Jews with fascism and Nazism. It targets Jews collectively, treating them as responsible for societal issues, and compares them to negative stereotypes. This aligns with guidelines that identify such associations as antisemitic, thus violating the JDA."

It implies that Jewish institutions are being specifically targeted, suggesting a negative stereotype about Jewish influence. The mention of securing Jewish institutions to maintain political favorability aligns with the idea of targeting Jewish community institutions and blaming Jews collectively for societal issues, which fits within the definition provided.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews are being uniquely targeted due to their influence, implying a connection between the Jewish community and political actions. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly point 7, which identifies holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct as antisemitic. The reference to securing Jewish institutions to maintain influence can be interpreted as coded antisemitism, linking Jewish influence to state actions, thus indicating an underlying bias against the Jewish community."

It does not involve any hateful content, conspiracy theories, or negative stereotypes towards Jews. There is no evidence of mendacious allegations, blaming Jews for wrongdoing, Holocaust denial, or other antisemitic behavior as outlined by IHRA.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, specifically by accusing Jews as a collective of responsibility for historical events that led to significant demographic changes in Palestine. The tweet reflects a stereotypical view that Jews are responsible for such actions, which is indicative of antisemitic ideology.",No,"The tweet provides a factual account of historical events related to the Balfour Declaration and its consequences. It does not contain any antisemitic content, such as stereotypes, hostility toward Jews, or expressions that link Jews collectively to negative actions. The mention of Palestinian displacement is presented in a neutral, factual manner without imputing blame or responsibility to all Jews. Therefore, it does not violate the JDA definition of antisemitism."

Not disabled, jews",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language that aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It targets Jewish individuals by suggesting they ""always play the victim card,"" which can be interpreted as a mendacious or stereotypical accusation. The use of ""jews"" (with an 's') suggests it refers to a collective group, and while not explicitly mentioning the Holocaust, it employs negative stereotypes that resonate with antisemitic tropes. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's framework.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Jews in a way that implies they are exploitatively using victimhood, employing negative stereotypes about Jewish behavior. This generalization targets Jews as a group, aligning with antisemitic discrimination as defined by the JDA. The use of ""jews"" (with an 's') could be seen as dehumanizing or stereotyping, falling under direct discrimination against Jews, thus constituting antisemitism."

This reinforces the narrative of Jewish victimhood and self-isolation, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes. By highlighting past expulsions and comparing them to the need for Jewish statehood, the tweet frames Jews as needing their own defense mechanisms, a perspective that is often utilized by antisemitic ideologies to dehumanize and scapegoat Jews. Therefore, this tweet crosses the line into antisemitic territory.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism under the JDA criteria. It accurately references historical events and expresses gratitude for Israel, a Jewish state's ability to defend itself, without targeting Jews or making negative generalizations about them as a group. There is no denial of the Holocaust, nor does it hold Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions, which are key indicators of antisemitism according to the guidelines.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes targeting Jewish individuals or their property based on religious identity. Here, the victims were attacked precisely because they are Jewish, fitting the definition of antisemitic behavior. This aligns with examples like physical manifestations of antisemitism and criminal acts targeted at Jews due to their religion, thus falling under antisemitic conduct as defined.",Yes,"The tweet describes attacks on three visibly ultra-Orthodox Jews, who were targeted specifically because of their Jewish faith. According to the JDA guidelines, this constitutes an antisemitic act as it involves hostility or violence against Jews as Jews. The victims were attacked solely for being Jewish, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism outlined in the guidelines."

This comparison trivializes the Holocaust, equates the suffering of Jews with another group, and promotes harmful stereotypes. By using historical atrocities to attack a different group, it aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes making false allegations or malicious comparisons that incite fear or hate. Thus, this tweet is antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet replaces ""Jew"" with ""unvaccinated,"" drawing a parallel between Nazi persecution and pandemic policies. This substitution is a form of coded speech that links unvaccinated individuals to historical antisemitic tropes, such as being unfairly targeted or having secret knowledge. By equating the treatment of unvaccinated people to that of Jews under Nazis, it uses classical antisemitic motifs, thus aligning with guidelines 2 and 4, which define coded statements and stereotypes as antisemitic behavior."

This ties him to a group known for antisemitic views and uses Nazi-associated praise, which reflects a perception of Jewishness tied to evil actions. It thereby aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish individuals through associations with hate groups and negative rhetoric linked to their Jewish heritage.",Yes,"The tweet links Kyle Rittenhouse's actions, which include the killing of a Jewish individual, to Neo-Nazis celebrating him. This association can be seen as antisemitic because it ties Jews (through Rittenhouse) to violence and aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes of Jews being linked to evil or harmful activities. The tweet expresses hostility towards Rittenhouse's celebration by Neo-Nazis, which reflects prejudice against Jews. Thus, it adheres to the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This phrasing aligns with antisemitic tropes that suggest Jews are being targeted or put at risk due to others' decisions, as defined by IHRA. It reflects a concern about collective blame on Jews, which falls under antisemitism as it targets Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet raises concern by asking if someone is willing to lose ""the Jews,"" which could imply a negative consequence tied to their removal. This phrasing aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes that link Jews to hidden power or influence, even though it's not explicitly hostile. Thus, it potentially crosses into indirect or coded antisemitism, as per JDA guidelines."

While the user does not explicitly state whether Israa is Jewish, the context mentions Jews as targets. This could imply a perception that links violent acts to Jewish identity, potentially reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes about Jews being responsible for violence or danger. The framing of such an event, especially when targeting Jews, aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming individuals or groups for harmful actions, even if not directly stated. Thus, the tweet falls under antisemitic discourse as it targets Jewish individuals and could perpetuate harmful stereotypes about the Jewish community.",Yes,"The tweet describes an attack on Jewish individuals in Israel, which constitutes violence against Jews as Jews. This aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA, specifically under guidelines related to direct or indirect hostility and violence against Jewish people."

It is focused on historical interpretation rather than contributing to antisemitism by blaming Jews collectively or denying their history.",No,"The tweet critiques historical claims about Jesus's origins by dismissing the idea that he was of North African descent and instead emphasizes his Jewish roots. It does not target Jews or imply any negative characteristics based on race or religion. The content is an academic critique rather than antisemitic speech, as it does not involve racialization, stigmatization, or collective responsibility towards Jews.

This could perpetuate negative stereotypes and imply that only Christian traditions are valid, aligning with examples of blaming Jews for cultural issues or marginalizing minority practices.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that non-Christians, including Jews, should tone down their religious celebrations during Christmas. This implies a requirement for minorities to adjust their traditions to accommodate the majority Christian celebration, which can be seen as discrimination against Jewish individuals as part of their identity. According to JDA guidelines, any generalization or imposition targeting specific religious groups can be considered antisemitic, even if it's framed within a cultural context."

It suggests that Jews should not be required to hide their identity, which could imply that Jewish individuals are being targeted or marginalized.
