It addresses historical events related to Holocaust Remembrance Day and uses a hashtag emphasizing prevention of future atrocities, without targeting Jews or using harmful stereotypes.",No,"The tweet discusses historical persecution of Jews during the Holocaust and uses the hashtag #NeverAgain to emphasize preventing such atrocities in the future. It does not contain any antisemitic content, as it neither applies classical antisemitic stereotypes nor targets Jews for their identity.

How ironic that a South African is supportive of apartheid. You support both terrorism and apartheid with your ignorance,Yes,"The tweet references exclusion of Jews from certain areas and links a supporter of apartheid (a policy that historically discriminated against Jews) to supporting terrorism, effectively delegating blame onto Jewish individuals. This aligns with IHRA's definition by targeting Jews with discriminatory language and associating them with negative actions, fitting examples of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet targets Jewish individuals by questioning their right to live in certain areas, implying exclusion based on their Jewish identity. It compares supporters of apartheid (a form of racial segregation) to those supporting terrorism and ignorance, associating them with negative actions that could harm others. This aligns with the JDA definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination against Jews as Jews, essentializing negative traits, and linking Jewish identity to harmful actions. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitic speech."

By the time the war was over, there were 70.  I don't care about Dresden and I celebrate anyone who burned Nazi cities.",No,"The tweet discusses the historical destruction of Dresden during WWII and references the loss of Jewish population there. While it acknowledges the suffering of Jews, it does not target them as a collective or use antisemitic tropes. It instead focuses on celebrating the destruction of a Nazi-associated city, without directing hatred towards Jews. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA examples.",Yes,"The tweet references Kristallnacht, a significant antisemitic event where synagogues were burned and many Jews suffered. It mentions the decrease in Dresden's Jewish population, linking to their persecution. The celebration of burning Nazi cities can be seen as trivializing or glorifying actions against Jews, thereby aligning with the antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA guidelines. This inclusion of historical Jewish suffering and destruction庆祝相关事件可以被视为aligns with antisemitic themes, making the tweet antisemitic."

That hasn't been the case for decades -- if it was ever true.,Yes,"The tweet refers to American Jews as single-issue voters focused solely on Israel, implying that their political choices are driven by this singular concern. This perspective stereotypically reduces Jewish identity to a political stance, potentially perpetuating negative stereotypes about American Jews. By framing their support for Trump in relation to Sanders' anti-Israel stance, the tweet may be making unfair generalizations that align with antisemitic tropes, such as blaming Jews collectively for political actions. Thus, it fits within the IHRA definition of antisemitism by incorporating assumptions that could harm the perception of American Jews as a group.",No,"The tweet discusses American Jews' political support being based on Israeli issues but challenges the assumption that they are single-issue voters. It does not engage in racialization, use antisemitic tropes, or target Jews based on their identity. Instead, it critiques a political behavior without linking it to Jewish characteristics. Thus, it doesn't violate the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It merely reports a request from German Jews for a media outlet similar to Fox News, without any hateful or conspiratorial language. There is no indication of blaming Jews for harm or using stereotypes associated with antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism according to the JDA definition. While it references Fox News, which is a specific media outlet, it does not explicitly target Jews or use classical antisemitic stereotypes. Instead, it humorously critiques media presence without linking it to Jewish identity or control. Thus, it is not considered antisemitic as per the guidelines provided."

It compares historical illegal actions and their opponents without targeting Jewish people, making mendacious allegations, or denying the Holocaust. Instead, it reflects on the evolution of laws and morality, not antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet uses historical examples to imply that aiding Jews during the Holocaust was wrong, associating Jewish individuals with criminal behavior. This links Jews to negative actions, fitting the JDA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish identity with hostility."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in reinforcing negative stereotypes and implying Jews are above societal norms or laws.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews in NYC are allowed to act without consequences, implying a special privilege not extended to others. This generalization targets non-Jews negatively by suggesting they lack such freedoms, constituting discrimination against them. It aligns with antisemitic stereotypes of Jewish exceptionalism, as defined by the JDA guidelines on coded language and generalizations. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic."

It associates the dissemination of such theories with historical antisemitism by linking it to past propaganda and potentially blaming Jewish groups for societal issues. This aligns with IHRA's definition, which includes using conspiracy theories that falsely blame Jews for global problems and drawing comparisons to Nazi-era antisemitism. The reference to ""45"" (likely Donald Trump) further ties the conspiracy to a political context, reinforcing antisemitic undertones by associating it with harmful rhetoric against Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet compares QAnon conspiracy theories to Hitler's antisemitic rhetoric about Jews, which links them to historical antisemitism. This comparison invokes classical antisemitic associations, making the content antisemitic as per the JDA guidelines."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, where groups are blamed or attacked based on ethnic or religious identity, going beyond ordinary criticism to reflect prejudice.",Yes,"The tweet targets Jewish individuals collectively by blaming them for voting for non-Jewish politicians, implying a negative judgment based on their identity as Jews. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination against Jews as a group for actions associated with their identity."

It discusses Jewish support for Azerbaijan without implying any harmful stereotypes, conspiracies, or discrimination against Jews. The content focuses on political alignment rather than expressing dislike or prejudice towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that many Jews are sympathetic to Azerbaijan due to their Jewish identity. This implies a stereotype where Jewishness inherently leads to political support for a particular country, which can be seen as discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their identity. According to the JDA, this constitutes antisemitism by treating a character trait (Jewish identity) as inherently tied to specific political views and potentially leading to hostility or discrimination against Jews."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by accusing Jews of being informants or betrayers, a classic antisemitic stereotype.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews should inform on their neighbors, implying collaboration or betrayal. This invokes antisemitic stereotypes about Jews being traitors, fostering hostility and discrimination against Jews as a group, thereby violating the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It discusses the community's recent attention without expressing hate or negativity towards Jews, aiming instead to provide information about their situation. There is no indication of targeting Jewish individuals, property, or institutions with harmful intent.",No,"The tweet describes the Orthodox Jewish community in NYC as ""all the rage,"" suggesting that they are gaining attention or popularity. While it may be interpreted as an attempt to inform outsiders about their community, it does not contain any discriminatory language, negative stereotypes, or hostile content directed at Jews. The statement appears to be a neutral observation about the community's recent prominence rather than an attack on Jewish people or their identity. Therefore, based on the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not considered antisemitic."

Kristallnacht was the Night of Broken Glass, a pogrom against Jews carried out by the Nazis in Germany. We are in the midst of Twitter's own Kristallnacht.",Yes,"The tweet equates Kristallnacht, a horrific antisemitic event, with Twitter's suspension of @JarvisDupont. By drawing a comparison between a social media action and the persecution of Jews during Kristallnacht, it dehumanizes Jewish individuals and invokes historical antisemitism. This aligns with IHRA's definition, as it uses the weight of Holocaust history to demean and blame Jews for actions taken by Twitter, fitting the criteria for antisemitic expression.",Yes,"The tweet compares Twitter's suspension of @JarvisDupont to Kristallnacht, a pogrom against Jews by the Nazis in Germany. This comparison draws on a historical antisemitic event to imply a connection between Jewish individuals and the targeted action. By equating a contemporary action with an atrocities against Jews, it evokes classic antisemitic tropes that link Jewish people to negative or violent outcomes. Such comparisons can reinforce harmful stereotypes and contribute to the marginalization of Jewish communities, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

By framing a question about Jewish voters' political choices, it risks implying that Jewish identity is inextricably linked to political affiliation, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes or marginalizing Jewish individuals. This aligns with examples of antisemitism that involve blaming Jewish collectives for societal issues or suggesting Jews have undue influence in politics. Thus, the tweet's wording could perpetuate negative stereotypes or marginalization, fitting into the broader framework of antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet ""@Ibutterfly34 Why would Jews vote Democrat?"" can be interpreted as making a sweeping negative generalization about Jewish voters. It suggests that Jews collectively vote for a specific political party, which aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes that portray Jews as being controlled by external forces or having their voting choices dictated by such forces. This type of implication can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reflect the idea that Jews are linked to particular political outcomes, which is consistent with antisemitic ideology as defined by the JDA. Therefore, this tweet constitutes antisemitism."

It critiques Biden's policies affecting various groups, including Jews, and highlights Trump's appeal to suburban voters through housing policies. While it discusses multiple groups, there's no use of negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews, making it a political commentary rather than antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet's mention of ""Jews"" in the context of policy decisions affecting other groups (like Blacks) can be seen as coded antisemitism. It links Jewish influence to negative outcomes, aligning with classic antisemitic tropes about hidden power and conspiracy.

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jewish or other groups for societal issues and using threatening language.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly targets Jewish people by ranking them before others and implies a negative association with religious underpinnings. It reinforces antisemitic stereotypes by associating Jews with undue influence or dominance, aligning with classic tropes of Jewish conspiracy."

This comparison could imply a conspiracy or stereotype about Jewish influence, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using historical antisemitic contexts to demonize Jews.",Yes,"The tweet connects the Supreme Court allowing Trump's wealth test for immigration with historical antisemitic measures targeting European Jews in the 1930s. This comparison draws on a past context where Jewish people were excluded based on prejudice. By associating current policies with historical antisemitism, it implies a biased link to Jewish identity, aligning with JDA guidelines that classify such coded references as antisemitic. The tweet thus evokes a racialized narrative that can be interpreted as targeting Jews, even indirectly, in line with classical antisemitic tropes."

This inference implies a negative stereotype of Jews, associating them with conspiracy or control. Such language aligns with antisemitic tropes of Jewish influence and hidden power, as outlined in the JDA guidelines, particularly points 2 and 4 regarding classical antisemitism and coded speech.
