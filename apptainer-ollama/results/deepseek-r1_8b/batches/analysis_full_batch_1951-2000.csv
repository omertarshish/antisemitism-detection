This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism through mendacious allegations and negative stereotypes about Jews as a collective. The use of racial terms reinforces harmful stereotypes, potentially targeting Jews collectively and delegitimizing their historical claims. Such statements can incite hatred and discrimination, fitting the definition of antisemitism as per IHRA guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains a statement that generalizes negatively about Jewish identity by implying a change in Jewish appearance over time, which can be seen as a form of stereotyping. This reduction of Jewish people to specific physical traits tied to their historical context is problematic and aligns with the antisemitic tendency of making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews as a group. Such statements can contribute to antisemitic stereotypes and are therefore considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

It neither expresses hatred towards Jews nor targets Jewish individuals or institutions. Instead, it acknowledges the suffering of Polish Jews (the Bundists) during the Nazi era, which is a historical reference without any incendiary or blaming language directed at Jews. The mention of ""#FireChuckTodd"" refers to a call for accountability but does not relate to antisemitism. Thus, the tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It discusses a family's historical tragedy without targeting Jews as a group or applying classical antisemitic tropes. The mention of Golda and her daughter, Polish Jews from the Bundist movement, refers to victims of fascism rather than promoting any negative stereotypes or linking Jews to evil forces.

By mentioning a census aimed at locating Jews followed by cleansing, it implies a justification or normalization of these atrocities. According to IHRA's definition, this aligns with making mendacious allegations about Jews as a collective and denies the Holocaust's severity. Therefore, the tweet exhibits antisemitic characteristics as it targets Jewish people with historical atrocities, contributing to harmful stereotypes and normalization of such events.",No,"The tweet discusses historical events related to the Holocaust, specifically referencing Hitler's initiation of a census aimed at locating and ""cleansing"" Jews.

I have blocked them, but ask that you do not report their account yet.",Yes,"The tweet contains multiple elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It uses blood libel, a classic antisemitic trope, and accuses all Jews collectively of serious crimes. This generalization can lead to discrimination and stereotyping, as mentioned in the IHRA guidelines. Additionally, the mention of evidence from their website and social media suggests a pattern of such accusations, potentially inciting hatred or violence against Jewish individuals. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet accuses ""ALL Jews"" of corruption, greed, blood libel, and murder. Blood libel is a known antisemitic trope, as outlined in guideline 3. This accusation treats Jewish people as inherently corrupt and guilty of serious crimes, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism by stigmatizing an entire group based on their identity. The use of ""ALL Jews"" exemplifies the essentialization of negative traits, consistent with guidelines A1 and A2, which identify such practices as antisemitic.

It refers to Orthodox Jews being targeted during a measles outbreak, having antisemitic attacks ignored, and being scapegoated during a pandemic. These actions reflect the blaming of Jewish individuals for societal issues, using them as scapegoats without fair justification, which fits the antisemitic tropes outlined in the IHRA examples.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Orthodox Jews being treated with attacks, ignored, and scapegoated during different crises. While not explicitly using classical antisemitic stereotypes, the mention of scapegoating based on the actions of a few implies collective responsibility, a form of indirect discrimination that aligns with antisemitic principles by targeting a group based on negative generalizations. This interpretation aligns with the JDA's definition, which includes forms of indirect or coded antisemitism that affect Jewish communities."

Antisemitism often involves using historical analogies to delegitimize or scapegoat Jewish people, reduce other groups' suffering, or perpetuate negative stereotypes. This comparison could align with IHRA's definition by reinforcing antisemitic rhetoric, minimizing the Holocaust's uniqueness, and potentially inciting hatred against Muslims.",No,"The tweet does not directly target Jews or use antisemitic tropes such as those outlined in the JDA. It draws a historical analogy between the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust and the current situation of Muslims in India, which does not inherently constitute antisemitism.

It targets Jewish individuals as a group, using harmful stereotypes and inciting fear, aligning with IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question references rounding up Jews, which evokes the Holocaust and constitutes direct hostility towards Jewish people. This aligns with JDA guidelines that define antisemitism as discrimination or hostility against Jews. The use of such language is a clear example of antisemitic speech, as it dehumanizes and endangers Jewish individuals by invoking historical atrocities.

The mention of ""Jews"" here appears neutral, relating to the comparison itself rather than an attack on Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet references ""30k Jews"" compared to ""1k followers,"" suggesting a preference for Jewish individuals over others. This implies a negative generalization about non-Jews, aligning with antisemitic practices of discrimination against a group based on race or religion. By linking the value of Jewish individuals to higher engagement numbers, it reinforces stereotypes and discriminates against non-Jewish followers, thus conforming to antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA."

This links contemporary actions to past events involving Jewish suffering, which can be seen as blaming Jewish people collectively for those tragedies. By associating Jews with the Holocaust's victims and justifying retribution, it aligns with antisemitic stereotypes that target Jews based on historical injustices. The use of ""jews"" in lowercase may also reinforce a specific, harmful stereotype, contributing to the perception of collective blame or demonization. Thus, this tweet meets several criteria outlined by IHRA's definition of antisemitism, including mendacious allegations and blaming Jewish people for historical events.",Yes,"The tweet references the Holocaust to justify retribution against Jews, which aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA.

It targets Jewish individuals by asking about their feelings towards Jews, which can incite or promote negative perceptions of Jewish people as a collective. This type of questioning could be seen as probing someone's attitudes towards Jews in a way that might contribute to antisemitic narratives, especially if taken out of context or interpreted within a broader context of hate speech. Therefore, it aligns with the IHRA criteria for antisemitism by potentially blaming or stereotyping Jewish individuals without explicit hateful language but through probing their collective feelings.",No,"The tweet in question asks, ""HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT JEWS?"" without assigning any negative characteristics or expressing prejudice.
