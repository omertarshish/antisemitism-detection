The content is informative regarding Jewish identification criteria without any antisemitic elements as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet discusses Jewish identity based on having a Jewish parent and identifies as such. It explains how someone can be considered Jewish according to Orthodox traditions.

It references a sensitive historical context and uses language that might perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jews, aligning with antisemitic tropes. The mention of Der St√ºrmer, a Nazi publication, adds complexity, suggesting an inappropriate association. While not overtly hateful, the implications could reinforce antisemitic ideologies, warranting classification as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet raises concerns under the JDA because it invokes a context that suggests Jews should have used an antisemitic publication like Der St√ºrmer to communicate their message. This implies a negative stereotype about Jewish people not acting appropriately, aligning with classic antisemitic notions. The reference to Der St√ºrmer, a symbol of antisemitism, contributes to this concern by linking Jews with a past era of persecution and suggesting they should have leveraged such propaganda for their benefit, which can be interpreted as a swipe against their judgment or actions. Thus, the tweet reflects elements of generalization and coded language indicative of antisemitic ideology."

This implies a conspiracy-like accusation, aligning with IHRA's examples of antisemitism that include blaming Jewish groups for negative outcomes or engaging in harmful stereotypes. The term ""Jews"" is used to dehumanize and accuse them of being responsible for failure after the conquest, which fits the definition of antisemitism by targeting a Jewish collectivity and using negative stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet references ""the Jews"" as being part of an intelligence center alongside India and France, and then labels all three groups as ""terrorists and evil enemies."" This associates an entire Jewish group with negative actions collectively, which aligns with classic antisemitic tropes described in the JDA. It treats ""the Jews"" as inherently complicit in something nefarious, reducing them to a collective guilty of wrongdoing. The JDA guidelines emphasize that such linking is antisemitic and falls under the category of hostility against Jews as Jews. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined."

By grouping both Jews and Hindus together as threats, it reinforces stereotypes where these groups are blamed for harmful outcomes, fitting into the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet equates Jews and Hindus as collective threats, which aligns with antisemitic tendencies by generalizing and stigmatizing these groups.

This aligns with IHRA's definition as it targets Jews by accusing them of being unfairly treated compared to others. It reflects antisemitic stereotypes where Jews are collectively held responsible for actions or outcomes, fitting the criteria outlined in the IHRA examples.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Starmer has expelled more Jews than other Labour leaders, suggesting a collective targeting of Jews.

The tweet stereotypically associates Hamas with antisemitic views, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet describes an attack on a Jew by a Hamas member who preaches hatred against both Christians and Jews. This directly targets Jews as a group, aligning with antisemitic hostility. While not explicitly linking Jews to a broader conspiracy or collective responsibility for Israeli actions (which would fit examples 7), the imam's explicit hatred towards Jews falls under classic antisemitic prejudice, thus qualifying the tweet as antisemitic."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews for real or imagined wrongdoing and exploiting their suffering. Additionally, the tweet's implication that certain groups have undue influence can be seen as reinforcing conspiracy theories or negative stereotypes about Jews and other communities.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that aligns with antisemitic stereotypes, particularly the suggestion that Jews are profiting from others' suffering.

I have no idea who these supposed Jews are that are just a religion and have no connection to Israel or zionism.,Yes,"The tweet suggests that some left-wing individuals hold a distorted or ""made up"" view of Jewish identity, disconnecting it from Israel and Zionism. This implies a misrepresentation of Jewish identity as merely a religious practice without connection to broader Jewish community ties, which can reinforce stereotypes and harmful perceptions about Jews, aligning with antisemitic tropes that deny their legitimate connections to Jewish heritage and collective identity.",Yes,"The tweet implies a negative stereotype of Jews by suggesting they are misrepresented without connection to Israel or Zionism. This aligns with JDA's guidelines on coded antisemitism and denial of Jewish rights in Israel, making it an antisemitic statement."

Such language dehumanizes and incites hatred, aligning with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, which includes using Holocaust symbols to demean others.",Yes,"The tweet references the Holocaust by likening it to the term ""unvaccinated,"" trivializing the horror of the event. This trivialization is an indirect denial and minimization of the Holocaust, as per guideline 5, which classifies such actions as antisemitic. Additionally, using a sensitive historical reference metaphorically may imply coded antisemitic language, further supporting the conclusion that this tweet is antisemitic."

This dualistic labeling aligns with antisemitic stereotypes that suggest Jewish identity is conditional, fostering a dehumanizing view where certain Jews are seen as manipulative or two-faced. Such reasoning can contribute to broader antisemitic ideas, as it implies negative perceptions of Jewish people based on selective labeling.",Yes,"The tweet utilizes language that reflects classical antisemitic tropes by associating Jewish individuals with negative stereotypes based on their political stance. It implies a double standard in labeling Jews, which can foster discrimination against them. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly points 2, 3, and 4, as it involves coded language that reinforces negative stereotypes and contributes to discriminatory behavior towards Jewish individuals."

It attributes the conflict to Israel, implying blame on a Jewish collective, which aligns withIHRA's definition of antisemitism as it can involve blaming Jews or Israel for issues. Additionally, the reference to historical Jewish contributions might be an attempt to counteract this blame, but the initial accusatory statements are sufficient to indicate antisemitic undertones.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that conflates Jewish identity with the actions of the Israeli state, which aligns with JDA guidelines by treating Jews as agents of Israel.

By dismissing such claims as lies and emphasizing map size comparisons, the tweet reinforces negative stereotypes about Jewish collectives and could perpetuate harmful antisemitic narratives. This approach dehumanizes Jewish people by suggesting false accusations against them are baseless without addressing underlying biases, thus falling under the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by the JDA.
