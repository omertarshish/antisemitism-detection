It falls under the category of antisemitism that targets Jews collectively based on their identity, as outlined in guidelines 2 and 10 of the JDA. By equating Israel with an aberration, it suggests a broader negative perception that could extend to all Jews, thereby conforming to classical antisemitic tropes and the principle of treating Jewish identity as inherently flawed or undesirable."

This can be interpreted as aligning with antisemitic tropes that connect Jewish identity with negative outcomes, such as blaming Jews or their collective actions for someone's guilt. While not overtly hateful, the association of guilt with support for Israel reflects a harmful stereotype that could contribute to antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet ""trump Support Israel and Now he is save #TrumpIsGuilty"" appears to link Trump's support for Israel with negative consequences, suggesting guilt or responsibility due to his association with Israel. While it does not explicitly mention Jews, the connection between Trump and Israel could be interpreted as reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish influence or control over political figures. This alignment with coded language that implies a ""hidden hand"" or negative impact of Jewish involvement in politics aligns with guideline 4 regarding coded statements and antisemitic tropes, even if it doesn't explicitly mention Jews. Thus, the tweet could be considered antisemitic as it reflects broader antisemitic themes without directly targeting Jewish people."

It aligns with antisemitic tropes such as blaming Jewish individuals or the state of Israel for harm and dehumanizing their actions. By accusing Israel of violence and calling for revenge, it reflects the kind of rhetoric that can contribute to antisemitism by collectively targeting Jews or Jewish entities. The mention of continuing a ""martyr's"" path could also invoke admiration for violent acts against Jewish people, furthering antisemitic ideology.

It associates the assassination of scientists by Israel with anger among Iranians and mentions taking revenge, which could incite hatred against Jews or Israelis.
