By dismissing critics of this claim as untrustworthy, it reflects a broader pattern of delegitimizing criticism of Israel, aligning with classical antisemitic narratives that cast Jews or Israel in a negative light. This association and dismissal of criticism can be seen as an indirect form of antisemitism, linking Israel to harmful actions and stigmatizing those who question such claims."

This implies that these individuals, possibly non-Jewish, were involved in a transaction linked to Israel and money. While it's not explicitly stated that Jews are involved, the mention of Israel and money could trigger antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish influence or conspiracy.

It references Jews (by alluding to ""the one country"" and tying it to events associated with Jewish individuals like Epstein and Maxwell) without explicitly stating Jews but using language that could be interpreted as targeting them.
