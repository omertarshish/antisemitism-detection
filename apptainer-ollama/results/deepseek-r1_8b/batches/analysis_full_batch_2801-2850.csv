But to focus on the holocaust is to ignore his contributions to vegetarianism. https://t.co/UP9XhBRA9v,Yes,"The tweet trivializes and diminishes the atrocities committed during the Holocaust by focusing on an unrelated positive aspect of Adolf Hitler. This approach can be seen as downplaying the gravity of the Holocaust, which aligns with the IHRA definition's example of denying the scope or mechanisms of the Holocaust. Additionally, the mention of Hitler's role in the genocide of Jews, combined with the emphasis on his non-related achievements, could imply a form of blaming Jewish people for historical events, another antisemitic tendency. Furthermore, using historical figures like Hitler to make statements that can be interpreted as justifying or admiration for their actions, indirectly attacks Jewish people and collective memory. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet trivializes and minimizes the Holocaust by highlighting Hitler's positive contributions while acknowledging his role in the mass murder of Jews. This approach downplays the severity of the Holocaust, as per JDA guidelines, which explicitly condemn any form of Holocaust denial or minimization. Additionally, it implies a form of admiration for a person with a history of severe antisemitism, further aligning with the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews because of their Jewish identity."

It references violent imagery involving Israeli Jews and promotes a narrative that aligns with harmful stereotypes about Jewish control over territories. By using such content, especially in a public forum like Twitter, it reinforces antisemitic notions and spreads hate. This includes the use of violent depictions to further political agendas, which can contribute to the normalization of antisemitic ideas. Additionally, the statement implies a separatist view that could be seen as denying Jewish rights or promoting hatred towards Jews, fitting into the IHRA examples of antisemitism. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet references animated videos depicting the murders of Israeli Jews in a children's program, which is an example of hostility towards Jews as Jews.

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly the tendency to link Jews collectively to governance issues, even if it's framed metaphorically.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism.

It is a theological statement rather than an expression of antisemitic sentiment.",No,"The tweet quotes a biblical passage (1 Corinthians 1:23) which refers to Christ being a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles. This verse is interpreted within its theological context rather than being an explicit or implicit antisemitic statement targeting Jews for their identity.

It references a specific incident where Jews were targeted, which adds to the concern. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in its accusation against Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own nation.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Globalist,"" referencing a ""dogwhistle"" associated with Trump, implying that these individuals are not loyal to the nation but instead tied to an international group. This aligns with antisemitic tropes about Jewish disloyalty, as globalism can be coded to suggest Jewishness.

This aligns with IHRA's example of accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing by non-Jews, which is considered antisemitic. Additionally, it taps into stereotypes about Jewish influence and control over events, fitting classic antisemitic tropes. Therefore, the tweet exhibits antisemitic sentiment as per the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet refers to replies expressing frustration over losing the ability to blame Jewish people for all global issues. This directly aligns with antisemitic stereotypes where Jews are falsely accused of being responsible for societal ills (see JDA guidelines 2 and 4).

It also implies that other groups are less reasonable, reflecting a stereotype of Jews having different priorities, both of which are examples cited by IHRA as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Jews ""playing a part"" and implies an overrepresentation beyond their population, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes of Jewish influence. It uses coded language to suggest Jewish overreach, which falls under the JDA's definition of antisemitism by linking Jews to negative conspiratorial narratives.

This critique can be interpreted as an attack on the Jewish community, suggesting that Jewish individuals or groups are responsible for not having their holidays recognized in the same way as other religions. Such accusations align with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, which include blaming Jews collectively for societal issues or denying them rights such as self-determination. Additionally, the mention of Trump and questioning his status as a white supremacist ties into broader stereotypes and conspiracy theories that can be linked to antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet compares the number of federal holidays for Christmas with the absence of recognition for Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. This comparison reduces Jewish religious observances to a trivial matter, implying that their significance is lesser than that of another religion. Such a statement can be seen as making a sweeping negative generalization about Jews, treating their traditions as non-existent or unworthy of recognition. According to the JDA, this kind of discrimination against Jews as Jews constitutes antisemitism. The mention of Trump and white supremacy serves as a redirection but does not negate the underlying comparison that reflects antisemitic undertones."
