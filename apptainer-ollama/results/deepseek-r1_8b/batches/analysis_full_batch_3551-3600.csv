This direct analogy trivializes the Holocaust and uses it to demean and attack a person, constituting antisemitism as it dehumanizes Jews and invokes historical atrocities for rhetorical effect.",Yes,"The tweet equates the cancellation of a fundraiser with the Holocaust, using Auschwitz Museum's authority to support this comparison. This trivializes one of the most horrific events in history, which is deeply offensive and anti-Semitic. By drawing such an analogy, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes and shows hostility towards Jews, aligning with antisemitic principles as outlined in the JDA guidelines."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes accusations against Jewish people as a collective for past actions or questioning their identity in ways that reflect harmful stereotypes or conspiracies.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that reflects antisemitic tropes by questioning Jewish identity and implying an exclusive claim to a place, which aligns with classic antisemitic notions of Jews being linked to a specific location.

This reductionist view trivializes Jewish traditions and can perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jews, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through the use of dehumanizing comparisons.",Yes,"The tweet equates respecting a non-Jewish individual's day with how Jews observe Shabbat. This comparison stereotypically links Jewish practices to an instance that diminishes their significance, aligning with antisemitic tropes by trivializing religious observance and potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews."

It critiques a specific behavior (blaming Orthodox Jews for community issues) without targeting Jews based on their race or religion in a discriminatory manner.

It suggests that non-Jewish groups should form their own nation, echoing harmful views linked to antisemitism by implying Jewish influence or control over national formations.",Yes,"The tweet draws a comparison between the existence of Israel as a Jewish state for 8.5 million Jews and the desire for a Hindu nation for 1,000 million Hindus. This comparison implies that non-Jews should not have similar rights, which aligns with antisemitic principles by denying the collective rights of non-Jews to form their own nation. It also suggests that Jews are uniquely entitled to a nation-state, a stance consistent with classical antisemitic stereotypes that single out Jews for special treatment or privileges denied to others. Thus, this comparison can be interpreted as an indirect denial of the right of non-Jews to exist and flourish collectively as Hindus in India, in line with antisemitic ideology."

This invokes the Holocaust and suggests another genocide against Jews, aligning with antisemitic tropes that blame Jewish people for societal threats or atrocities. The use of historical references tied to Jewish suffering supports IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes harmful stereotypes and implications targeting Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet references the ""6MWE"" insignia, which stands for ""6 million [Jews] wasn't enough,"" a clear nod to the Holocaust. This number is a well-known antisemitic reference often used to imply conspiracy theories or genocidal intentions against Jewish people. The inclusion of this phrase alongside a warning about genocidal forces rising in America ties into classical antisemitic tropes, which link Jews with secret power and danger. Additionally, using the Capitol Riots as an example could suggest a connection between Jewish influence and political instability, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. Thus, the tweet's use of coded language and references to the Holocaust falls under the JDA definition of antisemitism, particularly guidelines 5 (Holocaust denial/minimization) and 2 and 3 (linking Jews with evil forces)."

This critique targets Jewish individuals' historical experiences, aligning with antisemitic tendencies that deny or misrepresent historical atrocities against Jews. By dismissing the reality of Jewish suffering and implying criticism of their actions during a tragic period, the tweet reflects antisemitic bias, as it denigrates Jews collectively and invokes negative stereotypes about their behavior during a significant historical event.",Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic under the JDA definition. It negatively generalizes about Jewish behavior during the Holocaust by implying that Jews were passive, thus invoking harmful stereotypes. This aligns with guideline A1, which prohibits sweeping negative generalizations based on race or ethnicity. Additionally, it reflects a disregard for the historical trauma experienced by Jews, contributing to a harmful narrative that diminishes their suffering.

According to IHRA's definition, antisemitism includes actions directed at Jewish individuals or their property because of their Jewish identity. By specifically noting the targeting of Jewish individuals and highlighting such attacks, the tweet aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined, which targets Jews for harm based on their identity.",No,"The tweet reports an attack against a Jewish family, highlighting a targeted act of violence. While it acknowledges the existence of such antisemitic incidents, it does not promote or endorse antisemitism but instead informs about its consequences.

This interpretation reflects the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, where such actions are considered discriminatory when they deny rights to others based on their identity.",Yes,"The tweet ""Jews are indigenous to Judea"" is antisemitic as it invokes the notion that Jews possess an exclusive or superior claim to the land of Judea. This aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes, such as Jewish conspiracy theories and the idea of Jews having undue influence, by implying a racialized ownership of the land. The use of ""indigenous"" in this context can be seen as a coded form of antisemitism, reinforcing the belief that non-Jews have lesser rights or status, thereby targeting Jews based on their identity.

It invokes classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies aimed at destroying Western civilization, linking Jews to harmful actions against a specific group (Whites). This aligns with guidelines that identify such conspiratorial language as antisemitic, even if not explicitly targeting Jews in isolation but contributing to broader antisemitic narratives. The mention of this conspiracy becoming mainstream adds context about its evolving impact, further supporting the identification of antisemitism."

The use of hashtags like #piousfraud and #antisemitisme further reinforces this classification.",Yes,"The tweet equates crypto-Xtians to a problem comparable to antisemitism against Jews, using terms like ""they can't kill Jews but deceive them into converting."" This implies a negative stereotype linking Jews to deception and control. The explicit mention of antisemitisme as a hashtag further indicates an antisemitic context.

It compares Israel to concentration camps, a direct reference to Nazi atrocities, which is a classic antisemitic trope as outlined in the IHRA examples. Additionally, it dehumanizes Palestinians by suggesting they are confined in such camps, aligning with the stereotyping and dehumanizing aspects mentioned.

Additionally, it applies antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish (Israeli) control over states and religious identity, aligning with guidelines that equate such behavior with antisemitism.

It implies that converting to Judaism is something trivial or worthy of mockery, rather than a legitimate religious choice. This reflects antisemitic stereotypes that belittle Jewish conversions as inferior or non-genuine.

This reflects antisemitic stereotypes by targeting Jews based on their method of acquiring Jewish identity, which violates the JDA's prohibition against discrimination and hostility against Jews as Jews.
