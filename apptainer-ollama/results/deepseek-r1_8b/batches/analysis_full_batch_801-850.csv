This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes that attribute conspiratorial power to Jews collectively, often used to dehumanize and blame them for societal issues. By framing the US as unable to alter Israel's trajectory, the tweet perpetuates the perception of Jewish manipulation and dual loyalty, which are components of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet ""@ggreenwald The US is responsible for Israel, and it will never change."" can be analyzed using the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines to determine if it constitutes antisemitism.  

First, the statement generalizes that the United States is responsible for Israel's actions and suggests that this state of affairs will never change. This type of sweeping negative generalization about a population (in this case, Israel as a Jewish-majority state) aligns with guideline A1, which identifies such behavior as antisemitic.  

Additionally, the tweet evokes a conspiracy-like mentality by implying that external forces (the US) control Israel's actions. This mirrors the classical antisemitic trope of Jews being linked to hidden powers or conspiracies (guideline A2). Furthermore, it suggests that Jewish institutions (in this case, Israel) cannot change their behavior, which can be interpreted as holding all Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct simply because they are Jewish (guideline B7).  

Although the tweet does not explicitly mention Jews, the context of discussing Israel and its relationship to external forces (the US) can be interpreted as a coded or indirect reference to antisemitic stereotypes. This is particularly relevant given that antisemitism often involves blaming Jewish communities for global events or conspiracies.  

Therefore, considering the broader context of antisemitic narratives and the application of JDA guidelines, this tweet can be seen as antisemitic."
