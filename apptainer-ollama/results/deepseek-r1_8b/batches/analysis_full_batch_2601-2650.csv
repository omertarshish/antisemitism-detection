The mention of other groups does not mitigate the antisemitic content directed at Jews.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly mentions ""exterminating Jews,"" which is a direct and hostile act targeting Jews as a group. According to the JDA, this constitutes antisemitism as it involves hostility towards Jews based on their ethnic or religious identity. There's no need for coded language or context; the statement clearly directs violence against Jews. Therefore, the tweet aligns with the definition of antisemitism provided by the JDA."

It uses the Holocaust context to call against dehumanizing the LGBT+ community, not targeting Jews or Jewish communities. There is no stereotyping or hatred towards Jews; instead, it's a plea for empathy and understanding, using historical events to address a different issue.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism according to the JDA definition because it is a plea from Polish Jews urging respect for LGBT+ individuals, without targeting Jews or using antisemitic tropes.

It’s the jews who are unorthodox - like Christians who are not practicing who typically vote liberal. Always the way it is the more religious you are the more you tend to be conservative,No,"The tweet discusses voting patterns among Orthodox Jews and compares them to unorthodox Jews and other groups. It observes a correlation between religious observance and political leaning but does not contain any harmful stereotypes or accusations about Jewish people. The statement is an observation, not an antisemitic attack or demonization of any group. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet discusses voting patterns among Orthodox and unorthodox Jews as a factual comparison to non-practicing Christians, noting a trend towards conservatism with higher religiosity. This is an observational statement about political behavior based on religious practices rather than any negative stereotype or stigmatization of Jews. It doesn't essentialize Jews or link them to negative attributes, thus not falling under antisemitic criteria as defined by the JDA."

There isn't one thing that he said that wasn't true.",No,"The tweet refers to Sheldon Adelson, a Jewish individual, by name and criticizes his political actions, such as his donations to Trump and Republicans. While it mentions his Jewish identity, it does not involve dehumanizing language, conspiracy theories, or targeting Jews as a group. The criticism focuses on his political contributions rather than attacking Jewish people. Thus, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics as defined by the JDA. It specifically mentions Sheldon Adelson by name and discusses his political contributions, without linking him to negative stereotypes or conspiracies about Jews. While mentioning Adelson's actions, the tweet clarifies it is about him personally rather than Jews in general. Therefore, it does not target Jews based on their identity but addresses a specific individual's actions."

This connection could imply a stereotyping or conspiracy-like belief, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through the use of historical references to target Jews collectively. The inclusion of a smiley face doesn't negate the potential antisemitic nature of the content. Thus, this tweet is considered antisemitic based on IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet refers to ""jebusites"" (a historical reference) as ""Jews,"" using a playful tone with a smiley face. This does not target Jewish people but rather uses a cultural/historical term humorously, without any negative connotations or prejudice against Jews. It doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA, which involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews."

IMO, Owen Jones was right to challenge her on AS....",Yes,"The tweet references Kerry-Anne Mendoza specifically mentioning Jews regarding Auschwitz, which aligns withIHRA's definition of antisemitism by focusing on Jewish suffering in a way that could deny other victims and spread stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Auschwitz and corrects Kerry-Anne Mendoza for specifically mentioning Jews. This implies a denial or minimization of the Holocaust by suggesting that Auschwitz wasn't focused on Jews, which directly contradicts historical facts. According to JDA guidelines, such actions are considered antisemitic as they deny the atrocities committed against Jews during the Holocaust."

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, focusing on the persecution and killing of Jews. The inclusion of other groups in the context of violence further underscores the hateful nature of the message, but the primary antisemitic element is the direct reference to exterminating Jews.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly targets Jews by calling for their extermination. According to the JDA definition, antisemitism involves hostility against Jews as a group. The mention of ""exterminate Jews"" directly aligns with this definition, making the tweet antisemitic."

This aligns with the IHRA definition by targeting Jewish individuals as part of a broader group, using stereotypes, and blaming them for societal issues without specific evidence. It fits the category of antisemitism that involves accusing a collective of responsibility or contributing to harm, thereby reinforcing negative stereotypes and dehumanizing Jews.",No,"The tweet includes a list of groups, including Jews, criticizing their historical contributions to racism against blacks. While it may generalize, it does not specifically target Jews as a group due to their Jewish identity or link them with negative stereotypes, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

IHRA defines antisemitism as including the use of such symbols to target Jewish individuals or groups, especially in contexts that can be seen as trivializing or promoting hate. This reference aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitic expression, making the tweet violate their definition.",Yes,"The tweet references the wearing of yellow stars by Jews, which evokes the historical context of antisemitic persecution during the Holocaust. This symbol is directly linked to antisemitism as it dehumanizes Jews and associates them with degradation. According to the JDA, using such symbols to target Jews again constitutes antisemitism, reinforcing stereotypes and potentially inciting hostility or discrimination. Therefore, this tweet is found to be antisemitic."

It joyfully celebrates Jewish success without any negative or harmful stereotypes, language, or implications targeting Jews or Israel. There's no evidence of blaming Jews for wrongdoing, denying the Holocaust, or using antisemitic tropes.",Yes,"The tweet states that ""We Jews all are"" rich, celebrating Jewish financial success. This implies a generalization about the Jewish population being wealthy, which aligns with antisemitic tropes. The JDA guidelines highlight that such sweeping statements can be seen as discrimination or prejudice against non-Jews by stigmatizing others as less fortunate compared to Jews. While it may not explicitly target anyone, the generalization of wealth as a Jewish trait can reinforce negative stereotypes and constitute hostility towards non-Jews as Jews."

This is a factual report without any language or intent to demean, incite hatred, or target Jews collectively. While the information may have implications for discussions on health disparities, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which requires expressions of hatred or dehumanizing behavior towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet appears to link Jewish identity with a higher COVID-19 death rate, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes or implications that Jewish people are more susceptible to the virus due to their identity. While it may be based on a study, the wording could suggest an association between being Jewish and higher mortality without clear evidence of a non-discriminatory cause. This aligns with JDA guidelines regarding the potential for coded antisemitic statements and the importance of avoiding sweeping generalizations that link minority groups to negative outcomes. Such associations can perpetuate discrimination and thus qualify as antisemitic, especially if it implies that Jewish identity contributes to adverse health outcomes."

It critiques a political/ideological group and refers to ""the age group"" without targeting Jewish individuals or using antisemitic stereotypes. The mention of ""Jezziah"" appears to be a non-antisemitic term, focusing on a demographic critique rather than any form of Jew-related hatred.",Yes,"The tweet uses ""Jezziah"" in reference to an age group associated with Jews, targeting them based on their Jewish identity. This aligns with JDA guidelines (B7 and B9) where Jews are collectively blamed for Israel's actions or treated as agents. The criticism is directed at a specific demographic tied to Jewish terms, indicating antisemitic stereotyping rather than legitimate policy critique."

It contrasts the mayor's handling of ""mayhem"" in the city with restrictions on Jewish families in parks, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish individuals based on their identity and suggesting unfair treatment compared to others.",Yes,"The tweet uses language that generalizes about Jewish people being targeted by DeBlasio, implying a collective problem and contrasting them with others in a negative light. This aligns with antisemitic definitions as it involves negative generalizations and stigmatization of Jews."

This aligns with IHRA's examples of making mendacious or dehumanizing allegations about Jews as a collective.",Yes,"The tweet reflects a discriminatory attitude towards Jewish individuals of Eastern European descent. It questions the necessity for them to accept ""whiteness"" as a self-defining racial category, implying that such a requirement is unfair and based on a historical connection to non-Jewish groups like plantation owners. This perspective reduces Jewish identity to a racial construct disconnected from their unique historical background, thereby perpetuating harmful stereotypes and discrimination against Jews as a group."

It does not involve blaming Jews collectively, using stereotypes, denying the Holocaust, or targeting Jewish institutions. Instead, it metaphorically connects Antifa and Trump's actions to attacks on Jews, which is a political commentary rather than an antisemitic statement.",Yes,"The tweet equates Trump's attacks on Antifa with attacks on Jews, suggesting a connection between the two groups. This implies that opposing Antifa is akin to targeting Jewish people, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes of Jews being collectively under threat. The link between Antifa and Jews is framed in a way that could be seen as coded language, associating Jewishness with opposition movements, which aligns with JDA guidelines on coded antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet discriminates against Jews by implying a connection to Antifa, falling under the definition of antisemitism."

That's one of very many reasons why we needed to lock down much earlier and be absolutely clear on our messaging - with religious congregations not allowed.",Yes,"The tweet links Haredi Jews to pandemic-related government actions, potentially implying collective blame without substantial evidence. This could perpetuate negative stereotypes and align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting a specific Jewish group in a misleading context.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly contain antisemitic content. While it links Haredi Jews with the need for lockdowns, it doesn't use classical antisemitic stereotypes or language that targets Jews collectively. The mention of Haredi Jews is specific and refers to their religious practices rather than generalizing about all Jews. There's no evidence of racialization or denial of the Holocaust, so it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

Additionally, it references an ""anti-Semitic memo,"" reinforcing the idea that it is addressing a conspiracy theory about Jewish power, further qualifying it as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Jews controlling ""the law, the banks, or the world,"" which invokes classic antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish conspiratorial power. This aligns with guideline A2, which identifies such linked notions of Jews as inherently evil or possessing hidden influence. The statement generalizes negatively about all Jews, falling under essentializing and making harmful generalizations, as outlined in A1. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic."

It accuses both Christians and Jews of creating fabricated lies, which can be seen as a conspiracy theory suggesting these groups are working together to deceive others. This accusation reflects antisemitic tropes about Jewish manipulation and deception, particularly when it involves blaming specific religious groups for deceptive behavior aimed at causing harm or confusion. The mention of Allah appearing in a mosque and instructing someone to prepare for Jesus also ties into broader antisemitic narratives that suggest Jews (and sometimes Christians) are involved in manipulating religious figures to further their agenda. By collectively blaming these groups for creating and spreading lies, the tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes that are considered antisemitic according to IHRA guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet contains antisemitic elements by accusing Jews (and Christians) of creating and propagating lies. This aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that insinuate Jewish involvement in deceptive or harmful activities. While the tweet also discusses religious figures from Islam, the targeting of Jews for fabricating lies constitutes discrimination against them based on their identity, thereby meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

The content focuses on a call for action regarding policies and does not involve antisemitic rhetoric, stereotypes, or conspiracies about Jews.",No,"The tweet does not contain any statements or implications that are discriminatory towards Jews as Jews. Instead, it uses the perspective of Polish Jews advocating for human rights, specifically against the dehumanization of LGBT+ individuals. There is no use of antisemitic tropes, stereotypes, or language targeting Jews. The mention of the Holocaust serves to underline the importance of avoiding similar dehumanizing behavior, rather than being a reference to Jewish inferiority or conspiracy theories. The content can be interpreted as a call for respect and equality, aligning with progressive values rather than antisemitic ideology."

It is a critical comment about Sethrogen's handling of Israel's history, targeting his knowledge or stance rather than directing bigotry against Jews or Israel.

This statement directly implicates Jewish people in the commission of murder. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes blaming a group for harm done, either through violence or other negative actions. Here, it is falsely attributing a violent act to Jews as a collective, which fits the category of making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews. This targets Jewish individuals and could incite hatred or discrimination against them. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet implies that a person was German and murdered by Jews, which aligns with classic antisemitic stereotypes linking Jews to evil or violence.

According to the IHRA definition, this could reflect antisemitism as it involves targeting Jewish individuals alongside others in a way that may imply a negative perception or stereotyping of Jews. The mention of Jews among other minority groups being hated by fascials suggests a broader scapegoating or stereotypical view, aligning with antisemitic ideals of blaming specific groups for societal issues or hate. Thus, the tweet adheres to antisemitic criteria as it collectively links Jews with other targeted groups in a hateful context.",No,"The tweet lists various groups that fascists are said to hate, including Jews. While this mention could be seen as problematic due to its reliance on negative stereotypes, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA.

While it may offend or upset many people due to its subject matter, it does not explicitly target Jews as per the IHRA definition.

While it discusses the Holocaust, it does not deny or minimize its occurrence, which is specifically targeted by guideline 5 as antisemitic behavior.

While the act of cutting the lock is described, there is no indication that it is being used to stereotype or blame all Jews for a negative action.

This language targets Jewish citizens for their political views, invoking harmful stereotypes and reflecting a broader antisemitic stance by conflating Jewish identity with opposition to certain policies.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Israeli apartheid , racist regime,"" which applies a classical antisemitic stereotype by linking Jews (or Israel) to systemic racial segregation and racism. This aligns with JDA guidelines that consider applying such stereotypes as antisemitic, as it collectively implicates Jewish identity with evil governance.
