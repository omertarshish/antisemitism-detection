It uses hashtags like #NeverForget to underscore remembrance. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred or persecution of Jews, often targeting them collectively or using harmful stereotypes. This tweet does not perpetuate such behavior; instead, it commemorates a significant historical event. The mention of numbers and specific locations adds factual context without inciting harm or antisemitic views. Therefore, the tweet is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question is a commemorative message marking the 1942 roundup of Jews in Paris during the Holocaust. It does not contain any discriminatory content, stereotypes, or hateful language directed at Jewish people as a group. Instead, it serves to remember a tragic historical event and reflects an understanding of the Holocaust's significance.

It references George Soros, a Jewish individual, leading a ""Deep State"" conspiracy and links Joe Biden's potential win to Jewish control over America. This reflects conspiracy theories about Jewish influence in politics. Additionally, the tweet falsely accuses Soros of having a pedophilia problem, which is a dehumanizing stereotype. The mention of manipulating Spanish-speaking residents in FL through disinformation further suggests an antisemitic intent by implying Jewish manipulation of information. These elements align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, involving conspiracy theories and false accusations targeting Jews. Thus, the tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs language and ideas that align with classic antisemitic tropes, as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It suggests a Jewish conspiracy involving George Soros, implying hidden control over significant political processes, which is a hallmark of antisemitic narratives. Additionally, it associates Jews with controlling American politics under a Joe Biden presidency, alongside other groups, thereby racializing and stigmatizing them. This aligns with the JDA's identification of antisemitism through coded language and conspiracy theories, as well as the tendency to link Jewish communities to secret or harmful influences on society. Such language not only reinforces prejudicial views but also risks inciting hostility towards Jewish individuals, making it clear that this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic expression."

It asserts that Jews are the ""wrong type of minority,"" which is a demeaning and negative characterization of Jewish people as a group. This statement reflects a harmful stereotype by implying that Jews do not fit into the category of minorities in a acceptable way, contributing to their Othering. Additionally, the phrase ""racist hierarchy of woke anti-racists"" suggests that some who identify as anti-racist are engaging in racist behavior specifically targeted at Jewish individuals. This sentiment echoes conspiracy theories and antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence in society. The overall tone and content of the tweet work to dehumanize Jews and impose harmful stereotypes, meeting the criteria for antisemitism outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly targets Jews by stating they are ""the wrong type of minority,"" which implies their unwelcome status and dehumanization. This aligns with classical antisemitic tropes of Jewish intrusiveness and manipulation, as outlined in the JDA guidelines. Additionally, the phrase ""racist hierarchy of woke anti-racists"" suggests a pejorative view of another group, but the primary focus on Jews makes the statement antisemitic according to the definition provided."

It discusses someone else's supposed antisemitic behavior towards Catholics and the connection to Freemasonry, which does not inherently involve Jews. Therefore, under IHRA's definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet associates Jewish identity (specifically as Freemasons) with an alleged hatred towards Catholics. This connection implies a negative stereotype about Jews collectively being hostile towards another group, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes of Jews being linked to negativity or conspiracies against others.

This involves blaming Jews as a collective for manipulating societal institutions, echoing harmful stereotypes and conspiracy theories that IHRA identifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet reflects antisemitic ideas by linking Jews to a secret agenda, which is a classic antisemitic trope. It implies that Jews are manipulating societal movements for their own gain, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews due to their Jewish identity. This includes coded language that suggests a hidden power or conspiracy, falling under guidelines 2 and 4. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic."

This directly aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes statements that incite harm against Jewish individuals or communities. The quote uses a religious authority to justify violence against Jews, constituting a clear manifestation of hatred and intent to harm them. Therefore, it qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly calls for the killing of Jews based on their religious identity. This is an overt act of violence against a specific group (Jews) due to their shared characteristic of being Jewish. According to the JDA, such hostility directed at Jews as Jews constitutes antisemitism. The statement's direct endorsement of violence against Jews without any mitigating context clearly falls under antisemitic behavior."

This aligns with IHRA's antisemitic examples of stereotyping and dehumanization by blaming Jews for negative traits.",No,"The tweet discusses ""Rotwelsch,"" a historical language associated with various groups including Jews. While it connects Jews with a term linked to theft and vagabonds, there's no clear intent to stigmatize or discriminate. The mention is more academic than malicious, focusing on linguistic origins rather than promoting antisemitic ideas. Therefore, under the JDA definition, this doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as it doesn't involve discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews."

It also promotes unity and opposes prejudice, which are positive and non-antisemitic messages.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet ""@ByronYork Tough on swimmers AND Orthodox Jews"" does not constitute antisemitism under the JDA definition. While it mentions two groups being subjected to ""tough"" measures, it does not explicitly target Jews as a group or apply classical antisemitic stereotypes. The comparison between swimmers and Orthodox Jews is made without implying any inherent negative traits about Jewish people, nor does it require adherence to specific policies or actions tied to Jewish identity.

It uses a friendly Yiddish term (""Yidn"") and refers to a Jewish doctor providing public health advice, which is a positive and informative message.

This reflects theIHRA definition, as it singles out a group for their identity rather than individual actions, falling under antisemitic discrimination.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Israeli Jews were removed for their identity, aligning with JDA's guidelines. It implies collective responsibility based on ethnicity, as per point 7. This reflects antisemitism by targeting individuals for being Jewish, thus adhering to classical stereotypes and violating equality principles."

This passage has been used by antisemitic groups to promote negative stereotypes of Jewish people. By invoking this biblical text, the tweet implies that some individuals pretending to be Jews are deceptive and part of a fraudulent group, thus perpetuating harmful stereotypes about Jewish identity. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes mendacious allegations against Jews as a collective and the promotion of negative character traits through false associations. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Revelation 3:9, which describes individuals claiming Jewish identity as part of a synagogue of Satan. This interpretation connects Jews with evil or deceit, aligning with antisemitic tropes that portray Jews as conspiratorial or linked to darkness.

The use of terms like ""defining moment"" could reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish collective actions, falling into the IHRA-defined parameters of antisemitism by implying a concerted effort or influence that reflects broader conspiracy theories or exaggerated claims.
