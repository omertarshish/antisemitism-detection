This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jewish individuals or communities for societal issues. Such content reinforces harmful stereotypes and meets the criteria outlined in IHRA's examples of contemporary antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Jews are responsible for spreading Covid-19, which aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes linking Jews to harmful events. This is considered antisemitism as it targets Jews as a group with negative, harmful associations. It falls under guideline 2 by suggesting Jews possess hidden power or responsibility for adverse events and under guideline 4 as an indirect form of antisemitism through negative generalization."

While this practice included Jews, the tweet does not present this as a contemporary example of blaming Jews or dehumanizing them. It focuses on historical context rather than current accusations against Jews, thus not meeting IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet discusses historical events from the Ottoman Empire, specifically addressing the treatment of Dhimmis, which included Jews. It provides factual information about a past policy without applying it to modern Jews or suggesting any negative stereotypes. This context falls under evidence-based historical criticism as outlined in the JDA guidelines (point 13), which protects such discussions as non-antisemitic."

The content expresses a preference for Jews over Brits, highlighting them positively without any negative or harmful implications. While it may reinforce stereotypes, IHRA's examples focus on negative aspects like blaming Jews for issues or using harmful stereotypes. This tweet, however, is more of a compliment and does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet expresses a preference for Jews over Brits, which can be seen as making a sweeping positive generalization about Jews. This aligns with JDA guidelines that identify such utterances as antisemitic when they involve positive stereotypes or superior treatment of Jews. The statement could perpetuate classical antisemitical themes by implying a racialized preference for Jews, thus constituting discrimination against non-Jews and promoting Jewish supremacy, all of which are covered under antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Determination &amp; Ability to fight long term to achieve them.,No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior. It compares the time taken for various achievements—Israel's establishment, political freedom, and childbirth—using metaphorical language about ""dinner menus,"" which refers to complexity rather than targeting Jewish people. There are no elements of conspiracy-mongering, Holocaust denial, or stereotyping Jews that would align with antisemitic criteria as defined by IHRA. The comparison is general and not directed at any group, thus avoiding the characteristics of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet compares the time it took for different groups to achieve their objectives but does not target Jews as a group with antisemitic content.

This statement targets Jews with negative traits and implies that their inherent qualities pose a threat to world safety. It aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism by promoting conspiracy-like ideas about an entire group, thus qualifying as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet employs derogatory language that stereotyped Jews as having a ""suicidal bloodthirsty psychopath mental disorder,"" which dehumanizes and stigmatizes the Jewish community. This reflects classic antisemitic tropes of linking Jews to harmful or evil traits, essentializing negative characteristics about an entire group, and using harsh language to denigrate them, thereby violating the JDA guidelines against antisemitism."

This statement is about solidarity and racial justice, not hatred or discrimination against Jews. There are no elements in the tweet that align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, such as conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial, or collective blame directed at Jews. Instead, it reflects positive engagement in social issues, which does not constitute antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit any characteristics of antisemitism as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It is a statement of solidarity from Jewish individuals and organizations supporting Black Lives Matter. This stance reflects support for a social cause rather than any form of discrimination, prejudice, or hostility against Jews. The JDA guidelines emphasize that antisemitism involves treating Jews with discrimination or hostility as Jews, which is not the case here. The content is about collective support and does not involve any negative generalizations, stereotypes, or actions aimed at Jews.

Therefore, the tweet contains content that meets the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Nick Cannon making antisemitic comments about Jews controlling Hollywood and the music industry. According to the JDA, this type of statement aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes, specifically Guideline 2, which highlights conspiracy theories linking Jews to controlling various industries. Such remarks are considered antisemitic as they reflect negatively on Jewish identity by attributing power and control over specific sectors, fitting the definition of discrimination against Jews as Jews. Thus, the tweet is antisemitic."

This appears to be a report of an event where Jewish individuals took action against what they perceived as overreach by local government, such as locking access to their park. According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, it is important to distinguish between actions taken by individuals or groups and broader antisemitic behaviors that involve hatred, stereotyping, or conspiracy theories targeting Jews. There is no indication in this tweet that it involves mendacious allegations, stereotyping, Holocaust denial, or blaming Jews for harm, which are hallmarks of antisemitism as defined. The tweet seems to be a factual report rather than an expression of antisemitic ideology.",No,"The tweet in question involves Jewish individuals in NYC taking direct action to cut a lock placed by the mayor on their park. This describes an event where Jews are actively protesting or taking control of a public space, which does not align with the definition of antisemitism provided by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish), and it specifically identifies characteristics such as making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews, linking them to evil forces, or expressing hostility towards them. In this context, the tweet is more about the action taken by a Jewish community in NYC rather than any form of discrimination or hostility directed at Jews as a group. Therefore, based on the information provided, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism according to the JDA definition."

This grouping of an entire religious community aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which condemns stereotyping and collective blame based on religious identity. By associating criticism of BBC News with the notion that Muslims exhibit antisemitism, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reflects a dehumanizing view of Muslims as a group. This approach violates the principle of individual responsibility and contributes to the marginalization of Jewish individuals, falling squarely under the IHRA-defined antisemitic behaviors.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language that can be interpreted as making a sweeping negative generalization about Muslims, implying they inherently harbor hatred towards Jews. This approach essentializes a population (Muslims) by associating them with antisemitic attitudes, which violates the JDA's guidelines against such stereotyping and discrimination. By linking Muslims collectively to anti-Semitic tendencies without specific context or justification, the tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes and thus adheres to the definition of antisemitism as it targets a group based on inherent characteristics."

It focuses on a political issue without assigning blame to Jews collectively or using hateful language. Therefore, under the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet asserts that Jerusalem is uniquely a Jewish capital and downplays its Islamic significance. This reinforces antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jerusalem's status to Jewish identity (B6). It also uses coded language to suggest Jewish exclusivity (A4), aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as targeting Jews based on their religion."

This aligns with IHRA's definition as it involves malicious stereotypes and hatred towards Jews, making it an example of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet contains coded language that evokes antisemitic tropes by suggesting a hidden Jewish agenda in the repopulation of Palestinian cities, which aligns with classic antisemitic conspiracy theories. This implies Jews are involved in systematic actions against Palestinians, fitting the JDA's definition of antisemitism through indirect and coded references."

There is no indication of hatred towards Jews or any manifestation of harmful stereotypes, false accusations, or denial typical of antisemitic behavior. Without additional context suggesting a negative intent or association with antisemitic tropes, the tweet appears to be neutral or part of an unrelated conversation. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the given definition.",Yes,"The tweet ""@GarrettMilovich @ShaneClaiborne The Jews were."" references Jews in a way that could imply negative stereotypes or conspiracy, aligning with antisemitic tropes. It suggests Jewish control or responsibility for negative actions without positive context, fitting the definition of coded antisemitism as outlined in the JDA guidelines. This makes the statement discriminatory against Jews based on their identity."

They were the original slaves, after all.",Yes,"The tweet invokes a harmful stereotype by equating Jews with historical slavery and suggests they are owed reparations. This aligns with antisemitic tropes that blame Jewish collective suffering for current issues, treating them as owed compensation rather than acknowledging individual agency or the complexities of history. It reduces Jews to a monolithic group whose past oppression justifies demands without considering their diversity or contributions. Such rhetoric promotes a discriminatory mindset, fitting IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses the phrase ""Do the Jews get to ask for reparations? They were the original slaves, after all,"" which associates Jews with slavery and implies that they are owed reparations based on this historical association. This statement applies a sweeping negative generalization about Jews, reducing them to a group defined by past injustices in a way that dehumanizes them. It aligns with antisemitic tropes that link Jews to negative historical events to demean or exploit them. By making such an assertion, the tweet promotes harmful stereotypes and contributes to the devaluation of Jewish people, thereby meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Let�s also talk about why no one is allowed to talk about these facts without having to be sent for holocaust training ??,Yes,"The tweet appears to align with antisemitic behavior as per the IHRA definition. It brings up historical Jewish involvement in slavery and links discussing such facts to Holocaust training, implying that any critique of Jewish history is akin to Holocaust denial. This equates Jewish heritage with offensive topics, which falls under blaming Jews for past wrongdoings (point 3) and using Holocaust-related offenses to demean (point 6), both antisemitic tactics.",Yes,"The tweet references historical Jewish involvement in slavery and slave trade, accurate though it may be, presents this information in a way that could perpetuate harmful stereotypes. It frames discussing these facts as forbidden unless labeled antisemitic or subjected to Holocaust training, implying criticism of Jewish history is akin to antisemitism. This taps into classic antisemitic narratives about Jews' roles in negative historical contexts, thus constituting discrimination against Jews as Jews, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This aligns with the IHRA examples of antisemitism, which include blaming Jewish collectives for societal issues or holding negative stereotypes about Jewish influence in institutions. The mention of Jews having power can reinforce harmful antisemitic ideas, thus fitting the definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references a statement that implies Jews have undue control over media institutions, such as Viacom dropping Nick Cannon for his remarks. This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence and control, as described in the JDA guidelines. By linking Jews to power and implying their ability to enforce decisions against others, the tweet promotes negative stereotypes and coded language that target Jews based on their identity.

It references a ban on Jews and Christians, implying they are being disproportionately affected, and criticizes liberals for changing societal norms in ways that restrict free thinkers, potentially insinuating an unfair targeting of Jewish communities. This fits within IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes dehumanizing or mendacious allegations against Jews as a collective.",Yes,"The tweet mentions NYC DeBlasio defending a ban on Jews and Christians. This statement targets Jewish individuals based on their religion, which aligns with the JDA definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. Additionally, the reference to BLM protests being permissible due to ""profound meaning"" and the implication that free thinkers are banned suggests a broader context of discrimination, reinforcing the antisemitic nature of the tweet.

Using the IHRA definition, this targets Jewish identity with harmful stereotypes about Jewish influence and combines it with dehumanizing language, making it antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet contains an assertion that ""Jews run the world,"" which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA. These tropes equate Jewish identity with controlling powerful sectors of society, and while the statement may be intended as a compliment, it reinforces harmful stereotypes by essentializing Jewish people. According to the guidelines, such generalizations can be considered antisemitic, even if unintended negatively. The use of ""Nigga"" adds further concern, though the primary issue lies in the stereotyping of Jews. Thus, the tweet violates the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It does not contain any antisemitic elements such as negative stereotypes, racialization, or attacks on Jewish people.

Thanks @guardian,Yes,"The tweet refers to ""Jews as foreigners"" in the context of a ""dog whistle,"" which subtly implies that Jews are outsiders or not belonging. According to the IHRA definition, this targets Jewish individuals for their identity and aligns with examples of verbal antisemitism. The mention suggests Jews are being treated as non-belongers, fitting into the broader category of antisemitic language that isolates Jewish identities. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses coded language that implies Jews are outsiders, which aligns with antisemitic frameworks.

Instead, it reflects on historical circumstances and their consequences, fitting within the realm of speculative historical analysis rather than antisemitic content.",No,"The tweet discusses historical circumstances affecting Jews without targeting them for their identity or associating negative stereotypes with being Jewish.

This reflects hostility and prejudice against Jews based on their ethnicity, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism by stereotyping and implying collective guilt.

It uses a metaphorical narrative about silence in the face of oppression, referencing different groups being targeted sequentially. While it draws upon a well-known commentary on inaction and complicity, it doesn't involve antisemitic elements such as blaming Jews for conspiracies or using harmful stereotypes against Jewish individuals or collectives. Instead, it serves as a critique of moral indifference rather than an attack on Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet starts with the persecution of Jews, using the term ""they came for the Jews,"" which directly relates to antisemitic imagery and language as defined by the JDA. While it later extends this metaphor to other groups, the initial reference to Jews makes the content problematic. Antisemitism involves targeting Jews based on their identity, and even if used metaphorically, invoking the persecution of Jews can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or trivialize actual antisemitic experiences. Thus, the tweet aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as it negatively targets Jews in a discriminatory manner."
