It uses mendacious comparisons and stereotypes, implying a pattern of persecution similar to that of Jews, thus aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by dehumanizing both groups through such metaphors.",Yes,"The tweet draws an analogy between China's treatment of Muslims and historical antisemitic practices against Jews, which aligns with antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA. It implies that both groups are targeted similarly, reinforcing stereotypes of Jewish influence and conspiracy, thus violating the JDA guidelines."

It supports Israel's policies and defends its right to exist, without promoting any negative stereotypes or collectively blaming Jews for Israel's actions.

Black Jews exist."" does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by IHRA. Antisemitism involves negative perceptions or harmful behaviors towards Jewish individuals or communities, such as stereotyping, blaming, or dehumanizing them. This tweet is a factual acknowledgment of diversity within the Jewish community and does not contain any negative or conspiratorial implications. It simply recognizes that Black Jews exist, which is a positive and inclusive statement rather than an antisemitic one.",No,"The tweet acknowledges the existence of Black Jews within the Jewish community without implying any discrimination or negativity towards Jews. It merely highlights Jewish diversity and does not contain any stereotypes or negative generalizations about Jews, therefore it does not constitute antisemitism according to the JDA guidelines."

It connects the Holocaust with another supposed genocide and uses terms that can incite hatred towards Jews by conflating them with other groups, thus potentially spreading antisemitic sentiments.",No,"The tweet references the Holocaust and equates Holocaust denial with concealing another genocide but does not explicitly target Jews beyond the initial historical reference. It focuses on comparing different events and critiquing secularism in India through historical figures associated with Islam. Without direct mention of Jews or Jewish institutions, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA, which requires a specific focus on Jews or Jewish-related matters."

Antisemitism includes blaming Jewish individuals or groups for wrongdoing and can manifest through promoting negative stereotypes or collective responsibility. Here, the mention of arresting Jews could imply approval of actions framed negatively against them, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitic manifestations.",Yes,"The tweet supports an action where 36 Jews were arrested, suggesting their arrest is related to their Jewish identity. According to the JDA, any discrimination against Jews for being Jewish constitutes antisemitism. The act of arresting Jews specifically for their Jewish identity aligns with guidelines that treat such actions as discriminatory and prejudicial. Therefore, this tweet is deemed antisemitic."

This aligns with antisemitic tropes, particularly the denial or minimization of the Holocaust, which is explicitly listed as an example of antisemitism in IHRA's definition. The statement also uses language that could be interpreted as blaming Jews collectively for events, reinforcing the antisemitic nature of the tweet.",Yes,"The tweet references the Holocaust as legally justified, which directly denies its historical reality, violating guideline 5. Additionally, it implies a negative stereotype of Jews by suggesting their protection was an offense, aligning with classic antisemitic themes. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitism."

It focuses on the criticism of an issue rather than attacking Jewish individuals, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not directly target Jews or their identity but instead critiques the failure to address antisemitism.

While it documents antisemitic actions (attacks on Jews), the content itself does not express a negative perception or hatred towards Jews. It is a report rather than an expression of hate, thus not falling under the IHRA definition of antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet reports incidents of Jewish communities being targeted in Jerusalem, highlighting concerns about police response. It does not promote stereotypes, make generalizations about Jews, or link them to conspiracy theories.

Additionally, it uses religious texts to promote this view, contributing to the demonization of Jews.",Yes,"The tweet uses Quranic verses to assert that Muslims are superior to Jews and Christians, who are described as inferior and even subhuman. This content makes sweeping negative judgments about an entire group of people (Jews and Christians) based on their faith, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes that dehumanize non-Muslims. The statement incites hostility by denigrating these groups, meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It focuses on internal accountability and political stance among Jews, using a religious text to stress responsibility. While it may prompt discussion within the Jewish community about loyalty and values, it doesn't involve hateful rhetoric, stereotypes, or discrimination against Jews as a group. Thus, it falls outside the parameters of antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It addresses specific actions by some Jews and calls for accountability, without essentializing or stereotyping all Jews. The content focuses on holding individuals responsible for their choices, such as supporting Trump over Ilhan Omar and potentially inciting Islamophobia, urging others to take action. While it uses a Jewish text to emphasize responsibility, it does not employ antisemitic tropes like those involving conspiracies, evil associations, or collective guilt towards the entire Jewish community. Thus, it is not considered antisemitic under the JDA guidelines."

It expresses concern about a policy affecting various groups, including Jews, without targeting Jews for their ethnicity or religion. There's no hate speech or stereotype against Jews; instead, the focus is on the potential impact of the NRC process on multiple communities.",Yes,"The tweet references Amit Shah threatening to expel various religious groups, including Jews, based on their faith. This targeting of individuals or groups based on their religion constitutes discrimination and fits within the framework of antisemitism as defined by the JDA. By threatening to expel these communities, there is an implicit stigmatization and threat against them simply for being part of those groups. The mention of Jews in this context aligns with classical antisemitic tropes of targeting specific religious or ethnic groups with threats or expulsion, even if not directly tied to Israel or Jewish institutions. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria outlined in the JDA for antisemitic behavior."

This aligns with IHRA's examples of blaming Jews for negative outcomes and excluding them, constituting antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet references ""institutionalised antisemitism"" within a party, implying a systemic issue affecting Jews. It mentions ""taken toll,"" suggesting negative impact on the party due to antisemitism. The phrase ""except the Jews"" indicates exclusion of Jews, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes and coded language. This context fits the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes systemic discrimination against Jews as Jews."

Specifically, it fits the category of accusing a Jewish group for wrongdoing by a single individual or group, using harmful stereotypes. This reflects antisemitic behavior as defined, where Jews are collectively blamed without evidence, falling into the third example provided by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet in question attributes the Christchurch massacre to Jews, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that link Jewish groups to secret or malevolent influence over events. This blaming of Jews for such an event can be seen as a form of discrimination and prejudice against the Jewish community, as it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and conspiracy theories. The JDA guidelines emphasize that antisemitism manifests when Jewish people are targeted simply for being Jewish, regardless of context, and this instance fits that definition by implicating Jews in the tragedy. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the provided framework."

However, this is a critique of the policy itself, not an antisemitic attack on Jews or gays. IHRA's definition requires targeting based on Jewish identity with hateful intent; here, it's about opposing discrimination rather than directing hatred toward Jews. Thus, it doesn't qualify as antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly targets Jewish individuals by using the phrase ""'No Jews, No Gays, need apply'"". Antisemitism as defined by JDA focuses on discrimination against Jews. While it also mentions gays, the primary target is Jews, making this statement antisemitic. It opposes a rule allowing religious discrimination, which includes Jews, and directly references Jews in a discriminatory manner. Thus, this falls under antisemitism as per JDA guidelines."

It also praises Protestants for making the country nice, suggesting that without them, things wouldn't be as good, which can hint at a belief that non-Jews are more beneficial. This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish influence and conspiracy theories, as outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet refers to ""so few Jews so much on radio four about them,"" which could imply that Jews are overrepresented or incorrectly featured on the radio. This aligns with JDA guidelines that classify sweeping negative generalizations or stereotypes about Jews as antisemitic (see point 3). The contrast with Protestants being thanked for contributing positively may subtly suggest a negative stereotype about Jews, falling under indirect discrimination against Jews as Jews."

This implies a mendacious and stereotypical link between wealth and Jews, aligning with antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence or conspiracy. It reduces a political statement to a Jewish stereotype, promoting harmful notions that offend and incite hatred against the Jewish community. Thus, it complies with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by utilizing false associations and negative stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet references Jeremy Corbyn's use of ""millionaire friends"" and suggests that hearing ""Jews"" in this phrase indicates antisemitism. This aligns with JDA guidelines 2 and 4, which identify coded language that links Jews to negative stereotypes about wealth or conspiracies, thus constituting antisemitic speech."

This implies a collective blame or stigmatization of Jewish individuals based on their political stance, which aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly in targeting Jewish communities for harm and using mendacious allegations. The tweet effectively dehumanizes Jewish supporters of Palestinian causes by framing them as part of a delegitimizing effort, fitting the criteria of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Israel lobby groups are targeting Jewish individuals who support Palestinian rights, aiming to delegitimize them. This implies a collective responsibility on the part of Jews based on their identity and support for a cause linked to another group. According to JDA guidelines (specifically B7), this can be seen as antisemitic because it collectively holds Jews responsible for Israel's actions or treats them as agents of the state, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. The tweet thus aligns with behaviors outlined in the antisemitic guidelines, even if not explicitly hateful."

While this may reference historical or cultural connections between Palestinians and Jews, it does not contain elements of hatred, blame, conspiracy, or dehumanization typically associated with antisemitism as defined by IHRA. It is more an observation about perceived identity rather than an attack or stereotyping of Jews.",No,"The tweet does not directly attack Jewish people or promote hostility against them. It discusses the politicians' views on Palestinian identity, which is a political statement rather than an antisemitic one. While there may be implications about identity and rights, without incitement to hatred or violence, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

This approach reinforces stereotypes about who is Jewish and who isn't, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by potentially demeaning Jews as a collective through such categorizations.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It clarifies various aspects of Jewish identity without incorporating any harmful stereotypes, exclusionary language, or classical antisemitic tropes. While it notes that Christians are not Jews, this statement is a factual clarification rather than an exclusionary or discriminatory remark directed at Jews. The tweet's primary purpose appears to be educational in nature, aiming to correct misunderstandings about Jewish identity without targeting any group for discrimination or hostility."

It associates American Jews as a collective with political behavior, criticizes them for not knowing their history, and draws a comparison to Nazi-era gibberish, all of which are manifestations of antisemitism under the IHRA definition. This includes blaming a group for societal issues and using historical comparisons that reflect harmful stereotypes about Jews.",Yes,"The tweet uses a historical reference tied to antisemitic tropes (from 1936) to critique Trump's comments about American Jews.

This minimization aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes denying or trivializing the Holocaust. By implying that Jews should ""get over"" this event, the tweet promotes a perception that reduces Jewish suffering to something that can be dismissed, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and antisemitic attitudes. The use of derogatory language further underscores the offensive nature of the statement, targeting Jewish individuals by belittling their historical trauma. Thus, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic under the IHRA framework.",Yes,"The tweet from Judge Jim Lammey contains language that can be interpreted as minimizing or dismissing the Holocaust, a key element of antisemitic discourse according to the JDA. By stating that ""Jews should get the fuck over the Holocaust,"" he effectively dismisses the historical significance and suffering associated with the event, which directly aligns with point 5 of the JDA guidelines. This approach treats Jews as a group being subjected to hostility by diminishing their collective history, fitting the definition of antisemitism. The use of profanity adds to the hostile tone, reinforcing the judgment that this statement is antisemitic."

The tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes and contributes to an antisemitic perception of Jews.",Yes,"The tweet contains statements that reflect classical antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jews to disloyalty towards a state and implying political disloyalty based on Jewish identity. The first quote associates Jews with disloyalty towards the state, while the second equates voting for a specific party with disloyalty, both of which are examples of coded antisemitic language as per JDA guidelines.

According to the IHRA definition, promoting Holocaust denial is a manifestation of antisemitism, as it involves mendacious allegations about Jewish people and collectively blaming them for historical atrocities.
