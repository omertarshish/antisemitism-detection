This implies that Israel is involved in corrupt activities targeting non-Jewish individuals, which could be interpreted as collectively holding Jewish citizens (or Israel) responsible for such actions. Additionally, it may infer a loyalty to Israel over one's own nation, aligning with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly the accusations of conspiratorial behavior and targeting of Jewish communities. While not explicitly mentioning Jews, the implication ties into broader antisemitic narratives, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references Israel bribing a British MP and mentions that this act is being covered up by political figures. This implies that Jews collectively possess hidden influence or power, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies and secret operations. It also suggests that non-Jewish institutions are under Jewish control, a narrative that fits the definition of antisemitism as it links Jews to malicious actions against others. The tweet's implication of a cover-up adds to the perception of hidden Jewish power, furthering the antisemitic undertone. Therefore, this content meets the criteria outlined in the JDA guidelines for antisemitism."

This implies a negative association with Israel and by extension, Jews, through the lens of coded language that reflects antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish influence. The JDA guidelines indicate that such associations can be considered antisemitic, as they link Jews collectively to negative actions without overtly using antisemitic terms. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under the provided definition."

While the direct target is not Jewish individuals, the term ""ethnic cleansing"" evokes classical antisemitic tropes that associate Jewish identity with harmful actions against others. This linking can be seen as a form of coded antisemitism, where the actions of Israel are conflated with negative stereotypes about Jewish expansion or control.

This alignment, even if indirect, aligns with the JDA's guidelines regarding the treatment of Jews in relation to Israel, particularly when criticism is framed in a way that could be seen as targeting Jewish institutions or communities collectively. By associating pro-Palestinian content with antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracies, the tweet risks reinforcing harmful biases against Jewish people.
