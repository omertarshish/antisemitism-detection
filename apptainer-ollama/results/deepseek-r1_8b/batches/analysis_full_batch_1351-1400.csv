This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by suggesting a conspiracy-like effort to create hostility between Black and Jewish communities, echoing historical antisemitic tropes. The tweet's criticism targets anti-Zionists in a way that mirrors broader antisemitic attitudes, thus qualifying as antisemitic behavior under the provided framework.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it implies that anti-Zionists are attempting to manipulate Black individuals to foster hostility towards Jews, which aligns with classic antisemitic tropes. This conflation of anti-Zionist sentiment with a concerted effort to harm both Black and Jewish communities reinforces stereotypes and discriminates against Jews, thereby violating the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It also references Jewish symbols in the context of a Nazi demonstration, which can be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes and blaming Jews collectively for actions they are associated with. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in its targeting of Jewish individuals or groups based on their perceived loyalty or support for others, and its use of language that could be interpreted as demonizing or dehumanizing Jews.",Yes,"The tweet expresses frustration over Jewish symbols near a Nazi demonstration and criticizes Jews supporting Sarsour. According to JDA guidelines, this targets Jews based on their identity and support for others, aligning with antisemitic traits of stigmatization and collective responsibility, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism."

This could imply a broader context where criticizing Zion (often synonymous with Israel) and Jews is framed in a way that aligns with antisemitic tropes. While not explicitly using hateful language, the mention of ""Zion and the Jews"" within the context of opposition to Memorial Day suggests an underlying negativity towards Jewish identity, potentially crossing into antisemitic territory as defined by IHRA. Therefore, this tweet likely qualifies as antisemitic based on its potential to invoke harmful stereotypes or collective blame against Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet links ""Zion and the Jews,"" which aligns with JDA guidelines that classify applying classical antisemitic stereotypes to Jewish concepts as antisemitic. This reference can be seen as coded language hinting at negative Jewish stereotypes, thereby falling under indirect or coded antisemitism."

It associates criticism of pro-Israel lobbyists with corruption, evoking antisemitic conspiracy theories. Additionally, it links Ilhan Omar's identity as a Muslim wearing a hijab to the attacks she faces, which can be seen as stereotyping based on religion. These points fit into antisemitic tropes, making the tweet antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet connects Ilhan Omar's criticism of pro-Israel lobbyists with her being attacked because she is Muslim and wears a hijab. This implies that her opposition to these lobbyists is the reason for the attacks, potentially linking her to antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish influence and corruption. By associating her political stance with her religious identity, the tweet stigmatizes her in a way that could incite hatred against Jews or those perceived as Jewish, violating JDA guidelines on stereotyping and coded speech."

It does not exhibit behaviors such as denying the Holocaust, blaming Jews for events, or using harmful stereotypes, which would align with antisemitic behavior according to IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet discusses historical Jewish populations in Europe, addressing figures from 1938 and questioning their accuracy.

While it discusses historical and ongoing dialogue about Jewish identity, particularly left-wing Jews, it does not contain hateful language or incite violence.

The comparison to historical contexts acknowledges past discrimination but does not itself constitute antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet references a conversation where left-wing Jews are questioned about their Jewish identity, echoing a historical precedent experienced by the speaker's parents. This implies a stereotype that Jewish identity is tied to political or ideological loyalty, which aligns with antisemitic tropes such as questioning someone's Jewishness based on their beliefs (as seen in guideline 3 and B.7). The phrase ""Plus ça change"" emphasizes continuity, suggesting persistent prejudice against Jews, particularly left-wing ones, which falls under the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews."
