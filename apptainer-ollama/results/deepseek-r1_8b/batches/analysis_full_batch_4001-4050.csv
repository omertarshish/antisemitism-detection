This incident fits within the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it involves direct harm to individuals based on their Jewish heritage. Regardless of the attackers' motivations, targeting Jews for harm constitutes antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet describes a violent attack on a Jewish family in Huwara, Samaria, where they were targeted solely because of their Jewish identity. According to the JDA, this constitutes antisemitism as it involves direct hostility and violence against Jews for being Jewish. The inclusion of the hashtag #StopJewishHate further emphasizes the intention to combat such hate, aligning with the definition provided in the guidelines."

While it segregates individuals based on religious beliefs, including excluding Qadianis unless they convert or accept specific religious tenets, it does not target Jews specifically or promote hate towards them. The focus is on religious exclusivity rather than antisemitic behavior directed at Jewish individuals.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It expresses exclusion towards Qadianis based on their religious beliefs, but it does not specifically target Jews or apply antisemitic stereotypes. The content focuses on differing religious perspectives rather than discrimination against Jews. Therefore, under the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not considered antisemitic."

It also asserts that Zionists are not Jews, reinforcing harmful stereotypes by suggesting a binary distinction and dismissing any connection between Jewish identity and Zionist ideals. This reflects antisemitic narratives that dehumanize Jewish people and separate them from broader societal values, thereby violating the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet equates the actions of the Israeli government to an entire religion (Judaism), which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that link Jewish people to negative actions of the state. This association can be seen as racializing Jewish people, falling under antisemitism as defined by the JDA. Additionally, the tweet's assertion that Zionists are not Jews and Jews are not Zionists might reinforce stereotypes by separating groups, possibly implying one is more blameable than the other. Thus, the tweet crosses into antisemitic territory by associating an entire religious group with negative government actions."

This aligns with IHRA's definition by collectively addressing Jews in a negative way and using stereotypes to suggest a problematic behavior among them.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jewish support for Israel is characterized by a ""hateful obsession,"" which could imply a stereotype targeting Jews based on their political stance. This aligns with JDA guidelines that consider such collective blame or negative generalizations as antisemitic, particularly in the context of targeting Jews for their support of Israel. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic under the provided definition."

This minimizes his crimes and the severity of the Holocaust, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by denying or excusing the genocide of Jews.",Yes,"The tweet downplays Hitler's atrocities by suggesting he brought prosperity and isn't entirely bad. This minimizes the Holocaust, as outlined in JDA point 5, which considers such actions antisemitic. Additionally, it connects Jews to a negative historical figure, aligning with point 2 about Jewish evil.

It clarifies the user's stance on Palestine and Hamas and accuses another individual of holding antisemitic views towards Jews or Israel.

It refers to ""Zionism"" as a ""shame for humanity"" and criticizes the ""claiming of land in Jews' name,"" which can be interpreted as blaming Jewish identity for inappropriate actions. This collective blame reflects antisemitic sentiments by associating an entire group (Jews) with negative actions, thus fitting within IHRA's definition of antisemitism. The use of such language targets Jewish political movements and implies harmful stereotypes about Jewish behavior, crossing into antisemitic territory.",Yes,"The tweet criticizes Zionism in a manner that stereotypically associates Jews with negative territorial claims and control. It uses coded language linking Jewish identity to an perceived ill or evil (Zionism), aligning with antisemitic tropes of Jewish influence and control, thus falling under the JDA definition of antisemitism."

It equates Jews with a form of ethnic nationalism reminiscent of apartheid, reinforcing negative stereotypes and blaming the Jewish collective for oppression, which fits the antisemitic criteria outlined in the IHRA examples.",Yes,"The tweet uses language that associates Jewish identity with a negative regime (apartheid) and suggests that supporting Israel is wrong. It implies Jews are collectively responsible for an oppressive state and that their existence in Israel will be ""liberated"" by the Palestinian struggle, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes of Jewish conspiracy and power.

Bears 4 Corbyn!",Yes,"The tweet aligns with IHRA's definition by targeting Jews through accusations and stereotypes. It implies that caring about Palestinian issues is antisemitic, thus blaming Jews for these concerns. The use of ""fetishize"" dehumanizes Palestinians in a stereotypical manner, and ""stick it to the Jews"" suggests Jewish victimization.

The use of plural ""Jews"" without context attributes collective responsibility, which is a form of scapegoating and thus contributes to antisemitic tropes.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jewish individuals might engage in harmful actions due to their identity. This implies a negative stereotype about Jews acting in a certain way because of who they are.
