It references ""Jews control everything,"" which aligns withIHRA's definition of antisemitism as it targets Jewish individuals with a conspiracy-like accusation. While criticizing Zionism is acceptable, the use of this stereotype makes the statement antisemitic, especially as it relates to Jewish people rather than just Israel. The context doesn't provide justification for this claim, thus fitting the criteria outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet references an antisemitic trope (""Jews control everything"") while criticizing Zionism. According to the JDA, using such stereotypes constitutes antisemitism by linking Jews to harmful conspiracies. Thus, the tweet crosses into antisemitic territory as it employs a racializing stereotype against Jews."

It refers to the mass extermination of Jews during the Holocaust, which directly relates to Holocaust denial or minimization. Holocaust denial is explicitly listed as an antisemitic act in IHRA's examples. By expressing confusion and implying that such a statement is amusing or incomprehensible, the tweet undermines the gravity of the Holocaust and perpetuates negative stereotypes about Jews. Additionally, in many jurisdictions, denying the Holocaust is considered a criminal act, further reinforcing its antisemitic nature. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it involves dehumanizing language and denial of historical atrocities against Jews.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It addresses a sensitive topic without involving Holocaust denial, classical antisemitic stereotypes, or other defining elements of antisemitism. Instead, it reflects confusion about finding humor in a tragic event, which does not constitute antisemitic behavior."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by invoking comparisons to past atrocities and using language that mirrors antisemitic tropes about Jews being passive or unable to prevent their fate, thus fitting into contemporary examples of antisemitism that deny or downplay Jewish suffering.",No,"The tweet reflects a historical reflection on past antisemitism towards Jewish communities but does not target Jews as a group in the present. It warns against future rights erosion without applying classical antisemitic stereotypes to current Jews or Israel, thus avoiding any discriminatory content."

This content is a historical narrative without any antisemitic elements such as stereotypes, conspiracies, or negative generalizations about Jews. The tweet does not deny the Holocaust, use coded language, or link Jews to evil forces, all of which are criteria for antisemitism according to the JDA definition.

Fascist Nazis do.,Yes,"The tweet equates socialists with not executing Jews while fascist Nazis do. This implies that Jews are being blamed as victims of Nazi actions, aligning with antisemitic tropes that link Jews to historical atrocities, thereby meeting the IHRA criteria for antisemitism by accusing a group (Jews) of suffering from another's actions (Nazis).",No,"The tweet does not specifically target Jews or utilize antisemitic stereotypes. It employs a political comparison involving Nazis and socialists, which while potentially offensive due to Holocaust trivialization, doesn't align with the JDA's criteria for antisemitism. Antisemitism requires targeting based on Jewish identity, which isn't present here."

While it addresses specific behaviors of a group, it does not dehumanize Jews as a whole or collectively blame them for harm, which would align with antisemitic criteria.

This implies a negative generalization about Jewish identity, potentially linking Jews to harmful stereotypes or antisemitic ideas.

According to the IHRA definition, this type of accusation where Jews are collectively blamed for actions or targeted unfairly can be considered antisemitic. The statement implies harm towards Jews based on their identity, aligning with IHRA's examples of antisemitic behavior that involves targeting Jewish individuals or groups with discriminatory actions. Without specific context, the tweet’s implication that DeBlasio is targeting Jews as a group meets the criteria for antisemitism by implying collective blame and potential harm to Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that DeBlasio is targeting Jewish individuals or groups, which aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. Antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews based on their identity, and this tweet implies negative actions taken against them, fitting the criteria outlined in guidelines 1 and 3."

This statement trivializes and dismisses the gravity of the Holocaust, which is a direct denial and minimization of one of the most significant atrocities in history. The mention of Jews without capitalization further dehumanizes the victims. According to the IHRA definition, this behavior qualifies as antisemitic because it downplays the suffering of Jews during the Holocaust, thereby promoting a mindset that dismisses or denies the heinous crimes committed against them.",Yes,"The tweet in question trivializes the Holocaust, a deeply offensive atrocity against Jews, by using it for humor. This approach minimizes the suffering of those affected and perpetuates antisemitic stereotypes. By reducing such a serious event to a joke, the tweet spreads harmful views that can normalize antisemitism. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is considered antisemitic."

It accuses these groups of being antisemitic without specific evidence and implies discriminatory treatment towards Jewish workers, fitting the category of antisemitic discrimination. The tweet thus meets the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly mentions that BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) is not considered antisemitic but then directly states that an ethnic boycott targeting Jews is the definition of antisemitism. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines, which define antisemitism as discrimination against Jews based on their ethnicity, such as through targeted boycotts or actions that stigmatize Jewish individuals collectively. The mention of UNIFOR being anti-Semitic and Jewish workers not funding them further emphasizes the discriminatory nature towards Jews, reinforcing the classification under antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This aligns with IHRA's definition, as it involves rhetoric that incites hatred against a specific group (Jews), using language and actions that target Jewish individuals or their community. It fits the criteria of accusing a group collectively of wrongdoing and promoting antisemitic content, thus meeting the standards for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to a sign promoting antisemitic content linking Jews to inciting a race war. This aligns with JDA guidelines by using harmful stereotypes (guideline 3) and promotes an antisemitic website, which reinforces the hostile nature of the message."

This approach directly targets individuals' Jewish identity and serves to delegitimize their Jewish heritage. According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, such behavior qualifies as antisemitic discrimination, as it denies individuals opportunities or rights based on their perceived Jewishness. Additionally, this tactic aligns with broader antisemitic narratives that seek to exclude individuals from Jewish communities, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and contributing to a hostile environment for Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet cites the Torah to assert that someone isn't Jewish. This reflects a negative judgment about Jewish identity based on a religious text, aligning with antisemitic traits such as essentialization and exclusion of Jewish individuals, as outlined in the JDA guidelines (A1 and B10)."

It dehumanizes Jews by comparing them to pigs, a well-known antisemitic stereotype. Additionally, it refers to beheading Jews, which is a violent act targeting the Jewish community. The use of ""jews"" collectively implies a group-based hatred rather than individual criticism. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, including dehumanization and physical manifestations of hate.",Yes,"The tweet uses dehumanizing language by referring to Jews as pigs, a clear derogatory term. It also incites violence by mentioning beheading, which violates guidelines against hostility towards Jews. These elements align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, as they involve discrimination and hostility towards Jews as Jews."

This does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics as it doesn't involve negative stereotypes, dehumanizing remarks, or blame against Jews. It focuses on defining Jewish lineage rather than targeting Jews negatively.",No,"The tweet discusses the acceptance of patrilineal Jews within Judaism and the importance of Jewish unity. It doesn't exhibit any antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA, such as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. Instead, it focuses on internal discussions within the Jewish community regarding Jewish identity and inclusivity. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism."

It implies a secret Jewish power operating behind the scenes, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies. This targeting of Jewish people for imagined control over societal structures fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism, as it involves blaming a specific group for undermining or negatively influencing society.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that ""Zionist Jews"" collectively control various U.S. government institutions, such as Congress, the presidency, and political processes. This implies a belief in Jewish conspiracies or hidden influence, which aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes of Jews possessing secret power (see JDA guidelines 2 and 4). By associating Jewish identity with controlling political forces, it essentializes Jewish people and links them to negative, hostile imagery. Furthermore, it treats Jewish individuals as inherently responsible for the actions of these institutions, which is a form of collective blame that JDA identifies as antisemitic (see guidelines 7 and 8). Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism by using coded language to promote harmful stereotypes about Jewish influence in government."

It uses ""Jews are murderers"" as part of a broader comparison to racial stereotypes, highlighting the inconsistency in how such statements are perceived rather than directly expressing antisemitic sentiment towards Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet equates the statement ""Jews are murderers"" with racist remarks about black people and Asians, which directly associates Jewish people with violence. This generalization targets Jews as a group and fits the JDA's definition of antisemitism, as it promotes hostility towards Jewish individuals based on their ethnicity. The humor and sarcasm used do not mitigate the harm caused by the antisemitic statement."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jewish collectives for negative actions or conspiracies.",Yes,"The tweet refers to supporting a party that ""hates Jews,"" which aligns with antisemitic principles. Antisemitism encompasses hostility towards Jewish people as a group, including coded or implied biases. Here, the statement suggests an alignment with a party that dislikes Jews, contributing to antisemitic sentiment by associating Jew-hatred with support for a specific political stance. This falls under the JDA's definition of antisemitism, emphasizing the importance of not supporting groups that exhibit anti-Semitic tendencies."

While not explicitly targeting Jews, it uses historical context tied to antisemitic stereotypes and blame, implying a connection to Jewish influence or responsibility for negative outcomes. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism by indirectly associating a group (Germans) with harmful actions through a process that mirrors antisemitic narratives.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jewish people or use classical antisemitic stereotypes, metaphors, or language.
