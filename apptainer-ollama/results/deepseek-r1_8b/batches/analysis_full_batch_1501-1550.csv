It conflates race with religious identity, aligning with IHRA's examples of harmful stereotypes and collective accusations against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Black Americans are the real Jews, implying that Jewish people are not truly Jewish, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes about substituting other groups for Jews. This substitution denies Jewish identity and falls under antisemitism as defined by the JDA, particularly points B.6 and B.10, which address the denial of Jewish existence and the application of antisemitic stereotypes."

This aligns with the IHRA examples of making dehumanizing allegations about Jews, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to ""anti-racists"" who are willing to exclude Jews for tribalistic reasons, using the metaphor of ""throwing Jews under the bus."" This implies that Jewish interests are being sacrificed, which aligns with examples of antisemitism in the JDA. Specifically, it falls under guideline 4 regarding coded speech and the broader context of section B, where criticizing actions against Jews can be seen as a form of indirect antisemitism by highlighting harm to Jewish people, thus violating the definition provided by the JDA."

By implying that resting occurs ""on the Jews,"" it suggests demeaning or belittling them, aligning with antisemitic tropes that degrade Jewish people. This negativity towards Jews fits within the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes manifestations that express hatred or discrimination against Jewish individuals. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet ""And thus we will rest on the Jews, and upon the earth."" contains language that can be interpreted as making a negative generalization about Jews. By suggesting that the foundation is upon Jews, it invokes antisemitic stereotypes where Jews are seen as a burden or exploited group, aligning with classic antisemitic themes of negativity towards Jewish identity.

This framing targets Jews based on their identity, fitting IHRA's definition of antisemitism. While the attackers' race is noted, the primary focus is on the victims being Jewish, making the act antisemitic regardless of the attackers' race. The mention of leftists demanding an investigation into white supremacy could reinforce broader societal biases, further aligning with antisemitic rhetoric that seeks to dehumanize or blame specific groups. Thus, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet describes an antisemitic attack on Jews and criticizes a response tied to white supremacy. While the initial part of the tweet is about an antisemitic act, it does not contain additional content that targets Jews with stereotypes or prejudice beyond the attack itself.

It employs stereotypical and dehumanizing language, demeans Jewish individuals, and incites hostility, meeting the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet uses coded language that associates ""North London metropolitan liberal elite"" with antisemitic stereotypes of Jews, particularly through references to the alt-right and coded terms. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines on coded speech and the application of classical antisemitic stereotypes, even if done jokingly or sarcastically.

While it references historical persecution, it does not contain elements of blaming Jews for current issues or using stereotypes. Thus, it aligns with factual history rather than meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet references Jews seeking refuge in Israel due to historical persecution, which can reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish victimhood and contribute to a narrative that antisemitic ideologies exploit. While not explicitly antisemitic, it touches on themes that have been used to promote antisemitism, making it potentially coded antisemitic."

This can be interpreted as antisemitic because it reinforces harmful perceptions of Jewish conspiracy and manipulation of political figures for communal gain, thus meeting the IHRA criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references a statement that God chose Trump to save a Zionist Jewish society. While not overtly hateful, this implies an undue attribution of influence or power to a specific Jewish group, which aligns with antisemitic tropes that link Jews to negative or manipulative control. The JDA guidelines highlight that such statements can reinforce stereotypes of Jewish influence, falling under coded antisemitic language. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic."

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves expressions of hatred towards Jews and can manifest through comparisons that suggest harmful stereotypes or negative treatment. By equating Netanyahu's criticism of Arabs with a statement that could harm Jews, the tweet risks perpetuating antisemitic sentiments, as it implies that Jews are being targeted in a similar fashion to how another group is criticized. This form of comparison can contribute to the spread of antisemitic ideas, thereby aligning with the IHRA examples provided, which highlight the use of harmful stereotypes and comparisons to incite hatred against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet equates Prime Minister Netanyahu's rhetoric towards Arabs with antisemitic statements about Jews, invoking negative stereotypes and suggesting a link between Jewish people and threatening behavior. This aligns with JDA guidelines that classify such comparisons as antisemitic, especially by applying classical antisemitic tropes to Jewish individuals in a harmful manner."

This exclusion is based on ethnic or religious grounds, segregating non-Jews and restricting their access to opportunities available to others. Such actions align with the IHRA definition of antisemitic discrimination, which involves denying non-Jews equal opportunities by segregating them or treating them differently based on their ethnicity or religion. By limiting habitation to only Jews, the tweet reflects a form of exclusionary behavior that is considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet critiques Israeli settlement policies by stating that non-Jews are excluded from living there, which is a factual statement about government actions. While this exclusion could reflect broader discriminatory practices, the tweet does not invoke classical antisemitic stereotypes or directly target Jews as a group.

While the term playfully combines ""Jew"" with ""Exodus,"" it doesn't involve antisemitic tropes or negative stereotypes. It's a political statement about shifting affiliations rather than an attack on Jews or a conspiracy theory. The movement isn't framed as demeaning or harmful to Jewish individuals but instead as a shift in political loyalty, which doesn't align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet discusses a movement aimed at shifting Jewish voters away from the Democratic Party, associating Jewish identity with political loyalty to Israel.

This stereotyping implies a collective obligation of Jews to prioritize loyalty over critical scrutiny, which is consistent with examples of antisemitism that target Jewish groups for their perceived disloyalty or supposed responsibilities towards other communities.",Yes,"The tweet likely constitutes antisemitism as it reduces Jewish individuals' political affiliations (as Democrats) to a lack of loyalty towards Israel, reinforcing negative stereotypes that link Jewish identity with disloyalty. This approach marginalizes diverse political views among Jews and can be seen as coded speech that implies Jews should prioritize loyalty to certain leaders or causes over their own opinions. By associating criticism of Trump's policies with disloyalty tied to being Jewish, it conflates political criticism with antisemitic notions of hidden enmity towards Israel, thereby targeting Jews based on their identity rather than their actions. This aligns with JDA guidelines that condemn such reductions as antisemitic, as they imply sweeping generalizations about a population and link their identity to disloyalty or conspiracy."

While this phrase is rooted in religious texts, its use in a public context can be interpreted as implying a sense of Jewish superiority or special status. This aligns with antisemitic tropes that racialize Jews as a chosen or superior group (as outlined in JDA guidelines B.7 and B.8).
