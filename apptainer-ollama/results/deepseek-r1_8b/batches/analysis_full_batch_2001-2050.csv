It focuses on the organization's policy rather than promoting hate towards Jews as a whole. According to the IHRA definition, this falls within permissible criticism of specific actions without escalating to antisemitism, which requires hatred or negative stereotypes about Jews.",Yes,"The tweet targets @IfNotNowOrg for their campaign against Jews in Judea and Samaria, criticizing it as ""vicious & shameful."" This criticism implies collective blame on Jewish individuals due to their ethnicity, aligning with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA. It reflects hostility towards Jews for their identity, which violates the antisemitism definition by targeting them as a group based on race or religion."

While it uses the term ""problematic,"" it does not explicitly target Jewish individuals or collectively accuse them of wrongdoing or harmful stereotypes. Instead, it critiques a manner of discussion rather than promoting antisemitic beliefs or behaviors as outlined by IHRA's definition. Therefore, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic under IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet does not contain any statements that single out Jews for discrimination or hostility. It mentions fasting practices common to various religious groups, including Jews, Catholics, and Christians, without implying negative stereotypes or linking Jews to harmful characteristics.

This grouping could imply a negative stereotyping or scapegoating of Jews, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves dehumanizing or blaming Jewish groups for societal issues. The mention of irrational fears equating Jews with other groups suggests a broader context where Jews are unfairly targeted as part of societal concerns, fitting the criteria of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly mentions ""fear of the Jews,"" which fits under guideline 3 of the JDA. This fear is directed at Jewish identity and can be seen as an example of antisemitic utterance, as it generalizes negatively against Jews, aligning with the definition provided."

While the tweet attempts humor and critique, it references a conspiracy theory that has been exploited by antisemitic groups. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes dehumanizing claims about Jews and their role in historical events. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it regenerates harmful stereotypes.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic content as defined by the JDA. It critiques a historical antisemitic claim used by Nazis without promoting hatred or prejudice against Jews. Instead, it satirizes the notion that Jesus was killed by Jews, highlighting its irrationality rather than inciting antisemitism."

It critiques Trump's response to various events, including an attack on Jews in New York, but it does not use antisemitic language or target Jewish individuals with hatred or stereotypes. The mention of Jews being attacked is noted critically but without spreading harmful misinformation or demonstrating prejudice against Jews as a group.",Yes,"The tweet contains antisemitic elements by targeting Jewish people with a implied hostility towards them based on their identity. It suggests that Trump's lack of response to the attack on Jews in New York demonstrates his indifference, which aligns with prejudice against Jews as a group. This fits under the JDA guidelines regarding hostility or discrimination against Jews, falling under point 3 and reinforcing antisemitic rhetoric."

According to the JDA definition, any discrimination against Jews as Jews can be considered antisemitic. While the tweet does not explicitly state antisemitic beliefs or classic stereotypes, listing fear of Jews alongside other groups could imply a broader pattern of irrational or bigoted attitudes towards Jewish people. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines on antisemitism, which includes any form of discrimination based on Jewish identity, even if contextually neutral. Therefore, the inclusion of ""fear of Jews"" in this list may constitute an indirect form of antisemitic expression as defined by the JDA."

It does not express hatred, blame, or deny Jewish history and experiences. The mention of seders throughout history and during a pandemic, especially over Zoom, is done to highlight continuity rather than to demean or attack Jewish people.

It accurately presents a historical fact about exclusionary policies against Jewish immigrants in the 1930s without introducing any hateful or conspiratorial elements. The content is educational and based on factual history, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references a historical event where European Jews were excluded from the U.S. in the 1930s on Holocaust Remembrance Day. This could reinforce antisemitic stereotypes by suggesting Jewish influence or control over immigration policies without providing context, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes and potentially contributing to negativity towards Jews."

It aligns with remembrance and awareness efforts without falling into any categories defined by IHRA as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It accurately remembers the Holocaust, acknowledges history, and uses ""Never Again"" as a preventative stance, not as antisemitic speech.

Throwing paper towels at Puerto Ricans? Shithole countries? Remember when he wanted to buy Greenland? Remember Space Force?,Yes,"The tweet includes two key elements that fit the IHRA definition of antisemitism. First, it references Nazi actions against Jewish headstones, which directly targets Jewish property and heritage. Second, it scapegoats Jews for Trump's issues, aligning with the stereotype of blaming Jews for others' problems. While other parts of the tweet don't target Jews, the presence of these specific antisemitic elements suffices to classify the entire tweet as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it references historical antisemitic actions, such as Nazis vandalizing Jewish headstones, the content primarily critiques former President Trump's policies and behavior. The comparison to historical antisemitism is used to highlight poor decision-making, not to demean or stereotype Jews.

There is no indication of blaming Jews for wrongdoing or denying historical facts related to the Holocaust. Therefore, based on the IHRA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet contains the phrase ""May Jew, Muslim and Jews do a line dance soon,"" which repeats the term ""Jew."" This repetition can be interpreted as overemphasizing Jewishness in a context where it might not be necessary, potentially stereotyping or making unnecessary generalizations about Jews. According to the JDA guidelines, this could fall under treating a character trait as inherent ( guideline 1 ) and/or making sweeping generalizations about a group, even if done positively, which might violate the antisemitism criteria. Thus, this repetition is considered antisemitic."

By listing him alongside other groups that have targeted religious groups, it reinforces stereotypes and could be seen as blaming Jews collectively for past events, aligning with IHRA's examples of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet associates Adolf Hitler with other groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab as forerunners of the antichrist. This linking of Jewish historical suffering (through Hitler) with other entities could reinforce antisemitic stereotypes about Jews being part of an evil force. Additionally, it uses historical Jewish persecution to conflate various groups, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes of blaming Jews for conspiracies or evil actions. Thus, the tweet violates JDA guidelines by indirectly stigmatizing Jews and invoking harmful associations."

While it associates this stance with Jews and allies, it does not use antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories. It focuses on political opposition rather than negatively targeting Jewish identity, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet uses ""apartheid"" in a context that associates Jews collectively with systemic oppression. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly points 2 and 7, which recognize antisemitism when Jewish identity is tied to negative stereotypes or collective responsibility for harmful actions. By rejecting an alleged ""apartheid"" plan linked to Jewish identity, the tweet reflects a form of coded antisemitism, thus conforming to the definition provided."

It implies that Jews, as a collective, are negatively influencing situations, particularly in the context of Israel, thus fulfilling criteria outlined in IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet employs sweeping generalizations about both Jews and Muslims, assigning negative traits to one group (Muslims) while implying positive ones about the other (Jews). It references historical conflicts like the Six-Day War and connects them to political situations involving Israel, treating each group as inherently linked to their actions. This aligns with antisemitic guidelines by essentializing stereotypes, collectively blaming Jews for positive contributions, and negatively stereotyping Muslims, thus violating the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It critiques Telushkin's statement as absurd without using harmful stereotypes or collectively blaming Jews for antisemitism. The focus is on the content being incorrect rather than expressing hate towards Jewish people or Israel as a collectivity.,Yes,"The tweet references Reuben Telushkin stating that Israel is antisemitic. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. Here, Israel, as a Jewish state, is being labeled as antisemitic. Guideline B(7) indicates that holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct can be antisemitic. While the tweet discusses the state of Israel, it reflects a stereotype linking Jews to antisemitism, falling under the broader definition of antisemitism targeting Jewish identity. Thus, this statement is deemed antisemitic by the JDA criteria."

According to IHRA's definition, this can be seen as antisemitic by associating a specific Jewish demographic with societal issues without evidence of a broader conspiracy or negative stereotyping beyond mere statistics.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It is a factual statement about a specific demographic group's health statistics and does not involve the racialization or stigmatization of Jews as inherently evil or conspiratorial, nor does it link them to broader negative stereotypes beyond the stated data. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism."

Okay, so I need to figure out if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition provided. Let me start by reading the tweet again:

""U.S. soldier killed in Kenya, Trump says nothing.

Jews attacked in New York, Trump stays quiet.

Earthquakes affect millions of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, zero from Trump.

It’s not that he’s not our President, it’s that we’re not his constituents.

He doesn’t care about us.""

The user is asking if this is antisemitic using the IHRA definition. First, I should recall what the IHRA definition says about antisemitism.

From the given information, antisemitism includes any perception of Jews that involves hatred or discrimination against them. It can manifest in various ways, including rhetorical attacks, physical violence, targeting Jewish individuals or property, and community institutions.

The examples provided include things like blaming Jews for conspiracies, denying the Holocaust, accusing Jews collectively of wrongdoings, and using stereotypes to demean them. Also, it mentions that antisemitism can involve attacking the state of Israel, but not just criticism of Israel as a country.

Now, looking at the tweet, let's break down each line:

1. ""U.S. soldier killed in Kenya, Trump says nothing."" - This is about Trump not responding to a tragedy involving non-Jews (the soldier), which might be pointing out his inaction but isn't specifically targeting Jews.

2. ""Jews attacked in New York, Trump stays quiet."" - Here, the attack on Jews is mentioned, and again, Trump's silence is noted. This line directly refers to an attack on Jewish individuals, which could tie into antisemitism if it's using this incident to spread hatred or imply that Trump doesn't care about Jewish issues.

3. ""Earthquakes affect millions of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, zero from Trump."" - Another instance of pointing out Trump's inaction towards a non-Jewish tragedy.

4. The last two lines: ""It’s not that he’s not our President, it’s that we’re not his constituents. He doesn’t care about us."" - These seem to be the user's commentary on why Trump isn't responding, implying he doesn't care about people in general or specifically about Jewish people.

So, the tweet is comparing Trump's response (or lack thereof) to different events: a soldier killed, Jews attacked, and an earthquake. The comparison highlights that while Trump remains silent in all these cases, the user is suggesting that Trump doesn't care about his constituents or others affected.

Now, applying the IHRA definition, I need to see if there's any element of antisemitism here. Antisemitism can involve accusations that Jews are being targeted or that non-Jews are being favored over Jews in some way.

In this case, the user is suggesting that Trump doesn't care about Jewish people specifically because he stays quiet when Jews are attacked. The comparison with other events where he's silent (a soldier killed and an earthquake) is used to suggest that Trump only cares about certain groups. But wait, the first example is a U.S. soldier, who is non-Jewish, being killed in Kenya. So Trump's silence there is noted, but then the second point is Jews attacked in New York.

The user is pointing out that while Trump stays quiet during both cases (soldier and earthquake), when Jews are attacked, it's mentioned again. The implication seems to be that Trump doesn't care about non-Jews because he's silent when they die or when natural disasters happen, but specifically mentions the attack on Jews, perhaps suggesting he should have acted differently.

However, I'm not sure if this is directly accusing Jews of anything or using antisemitic stereotypes. It seems more like criticism of Trump's response across different groups rather than targeting Jews as a people. The user is pointing out that Trump doesn't care about all these groups, but it's not specifically blaming Jews for any wrongdoing or conspiracy.

Looking back at the IHRA examples, one point is accusing Jews of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing by a single Jewish person or group, or even acts by non-Jews. Another is denying the Holocaust or inventing it. There's also using classic antisemitic symbols or comparing to Nazis.

In this tweet, I don't see any direct mention of Jews conspiring, blaming them for events, or denying the Holocaust. It's more about Trump's inaction across different groups, including Jews. So maybe it's not antisemitic because it's not targeting Jews specifically beyond pointing out an event involving them.

But wait, the user is implying that while Trump doesn't care about non-Jews (like the soldier and earthquake victims), he particularly doesn't care about Jews as well. This could be seen as using the attack on Jews to highlight a pattern of Trump's inaction, which might reinforce a stereotype that Jews are less valued or that Trump is indifferent to their suffering.

However, antisemitism isn't just about inaction; it's about manifesting hate towards Jews. The tweet doesn't express hatred towards Jews but rather criticism of Trump's response times across different groups. It's more about his policies or actions than about the Jewish people themselves.

Another angle: the user could be implying that Trump is neglectful of all people, including Jews, but that's a general statement, not specifically targeting Jews as a group. So it might not meet the threshold for antisemitism as per IHRA's definition.

But wait, looking at the IHRA examples again, one point is accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own nations. The tweet doesn't touch on loyalty but more on Trump's lack of concern. Also, another example is denying the Holocaust; this tweet doesn't do that either.

So perhaps this isn't antisemitic because it's not targeting Jews directly beyond mentioning an attack on them. It's about Trump's response to different events, which may not be specifically antisemitic.

Alternatively, someone might interpret it as suggesting that Trump ignores Jewish issues more than others, but without evidence or specific accusations against Jews, it's just criticism of his response.

Therefore, considering all this, I think the tweet doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition because it's about Trump's inaction towards various groups and doesn't target Jews specifically with harmful stereotypes or content.
