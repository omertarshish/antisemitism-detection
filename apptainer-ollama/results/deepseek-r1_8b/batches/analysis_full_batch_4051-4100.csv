First, it asserts that Jews in Israel are not descendants of Judean Hebrews but instead Kazaria converts, which is a form of essentializing and questioning Jewish heritage. This can be seen as an attempt to deny the authentic Jewish identity of Israelis. Second, the tweet implies that Palestinian people have a genetic claim to the land, which could be interpreted as a racialized argument denying Jewish rights to the land.

It involves blaming or harming Jews for societal issues and using stereotypes to justify attacks on them.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that can be interpreted as dismissing antisemitic attacks on Jews while emphasizing the importance of Palestinian solidarity.
