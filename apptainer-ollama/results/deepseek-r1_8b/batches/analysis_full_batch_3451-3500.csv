It is a factual recounting of a tragic part of history, specifically the victims' experience leading to the gas chambers. This statement does not reflect antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, which involves expressing hatred towards Jews or targeting Jewish individuals or communities with malicious intent. Instead, it simply conveys information about a historical event without any inflammatory or discriminatory content. Therefore, the tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question provides a factual account of Hungarian Jews at Auschwitz during May 1944, specifically mentioning their journey to gas chambers. This is a historical fact without any denying or minimizing the Holocaust. The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination against Jews or Jewish institutions, including Holocaust denial. Since the tweet does not deny the Holocaust but rather details an historical event, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA guidelines."

While it describes violent acts and suffering endured by Jews, the content does not contain hateful language, stereotyping, or conspiracy theories directed at Jews. Instead, it serves to educate about a significant historical event without promoting antisemitic ideals. Therefore, under the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet provides a factual account of Kristallnacht, detailing historical events that are well-documented. It does not contain any language or imagery that seeks to dehumanize Jews as a group, nor does it promote stereotypes or antisemitic conspiracy theories. While the event described is inherently tragic and associated with antisemitism, the tweet does not engage in current or coded antisemitic speech but rather recounts history. Therefore, based on the JDA guidelines, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic."

I don’t understand the hypocrisy.,Yes,"The tweet uses language that targets Jewish individuals who oppose Zionism by implying they are obsessive or hypocritical in their focus on Israel. This reflects a stereotype where Jews are collectively blamed for societal issues and denied self-determination, aligning with antisemitic tropes. The term ""antizionist"" is used pejoratively, suggesting disloyalty, and the implication that these Jews have hidden motives contributes to harmful stereotypes. Thus, it adheres to the IHRA definition of antisemitism by attacking Jewish collectives through negative rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet references ""antizionist Jews"" who deny any Jewish connection to Israel, using terms like ""obsess"" and ""hypocrisy."" This implies a negative stereotype about Jewish behavior and loyalty. By questioning their commitment through excessive focus on Israel, it echoes classical antisemitic tropes of disloyalty and excessive influence. The characterization plays into indirect antisemitism by associating these Jews with negative traits, thus aligning with JDA guidelines that condemn such discrimination against Jews as Jews."

It also implies that other Jewish groups may avoid such treatment through certain behaviors or ideologies. This targeting of a specific Jewish group for their appearance or behavior aligns with antisemitic stereotypes and practices, as it singles out Jews based on their identity, which is prohibited under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet discriminates against Orthodox/Hasidim Jews by targeting them based on their visible Jewish identity, implying they face consequences while others do not. This aligns with antisemitic criteria as it singles out a group for discrimination due to their Jewish identity, in line with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

We're our own worst enemies.",No,"The tweet discusses harassment experienced by a female priest from other Christians, highlighting it as the primary source of her frustration and considering leaving her position due to this treatment. This situation is about intra-faith harassment and decline in church participation, not about Jewish individuals or antisemitic attitudes towards Jews. There is no evidence here of targeting based on Jewish identity or antisemitic stereotypes. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not target Jews or involve any antisemitic content.

This is a factual observation about history without any hateful or antisemitic content, such as mendacious allegations or stereotypes against Jewish people. There's no indication of blaming Jews collectively for wrongdoing or denying Holocaust facts, which are hallmarks of antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet discusses the decay of buildings in Terezin, a historical site associated with the Holocaust. It does not mention Jews directly or imply any negative stereotypes about them. The focus is on the physical condition of the buildings rather than targeting Jewish people or institutions.

(Also, you’re a complete batshit racist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, Parkland mass shooting denier, White supremacist.) https://t.co/hp7VAVfarF",Yes,"The tweet uses language that associates American Jews with another country, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes of Jewish influence or control over other nations. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly its mention of conspiracy theories and stereotyping. The additional insults further contextualize the antisemitic undertone without directly stating beliefs, but the association itself is sufficient to classify it as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet associates American Jews with a ""completely different country,"" suggesting they are out of place and possibly foreign agents. This aligns with JDA guidelines that prohibit stereotyping Jews, as it implies they don't belong where they are, which can contribute to antisemitic notions of othering and racializing Jews. Additionally, the inclusion of antisemitism in a broader attack on character further reinforces the targeted discrimination against Jews specifically. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under JDA guidelines."

It addresses educational disparities and socio-economic issues without targeting Jews with conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial, or stereotypical language. The mention of American Jews is merely a rhetorical question about teachers, not an attempt to harm Jewish individuals or promote antisemitic ideas.",Yes,"The tweet targets ""American Jews"" and uses coded language suggesting that they are part of an ownership class withholding educational opportunities.

It labels Democrats and Corporate Fascists as persecutors, but without explicitly targeting Jewish individuals or using antisemitic stereotypes. The focus is on the misuse of historical events for political purposes rather than on Jews or Jewish-related content, which aligns with IHRA's criteria that criticism of policies or countries doesn't inherently equate to antisemitism unless it involves targeting Jews or using stereotypes. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet draws a parallel between the Nazi persecution of Jews in 1933 and the treatment of conservatives in 2021, using terms like ""Corporate Fascists"" which imply Jewish influence.

This formula even allows the hater to imagine himself “open-minded.”",Yes,"The tweet employs harmful stereotypes by describing Jews as cunning and Black people as strong, which are derogatory and reinforcing biases. It also implies that only white men possess balanced virtues, potentially marginalizing others. Such statements align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through stereotyping and mendacious allegations about Jewish people, contributing to a climate that can incite hatred.",Yes,"The tweet incorporates antisemitic elements by stereotyping Jews as cunning and implying a superior white identity. It aligns with classical antisemitic themes, including negative stereotypes about Jewish traits and the promotion of racial superiority, which falls under the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It highlights similarities between the two groups, including dietary restrictions and cultural habits, but doesn't employ stereotypes or negative attributions towards Jews. While it draws a comparison to Christians, this isn't antisemitic as it doesn't involve blaming Jews for conspiracies, denying Holocaust facts, or using Nazi analogies. Thus, the tweet doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism according to IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet violates the JDA by making sweeping generalizations and essentializing religious practices of both Muslims and Jews. It reduces their identities to stereotypical behaviors, thereby disregarding their individual complexities. This approach aligns with antisemitic tendencies as it groups these groups together without recognizing their full identities beyond specific traits."

This brings up the concern of Holocaust denial or minimizing its severity, which aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA. By questioning the presence of such beliefs among supporters of public figures with Jewish backgrounds, the tweet touches on antisemitic stereotypes and implications, thus falling under antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet questions the number of Jews killed during the Holocaust and suggests that pro-Trump crowds include people who hold this belief. This implies a denial or minimization of the Holocaust ( guideline 5), which is explicitly listed as antisemitic. Additionally, by targeting Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner personally, it collectively stigmatizes all Jews, suggesting they are responsible for such beliefs.
