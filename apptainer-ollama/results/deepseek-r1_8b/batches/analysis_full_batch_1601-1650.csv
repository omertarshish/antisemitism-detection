It specifically mentions that claiming Jews and Zionists are interchangeable or that all Jews are accountable for Israel's actions is a clear antisemitic trope, as it falsely holds an entire group collectively responsible. This directly matches the example provided by IHRA regarding collective blame, making the tweet antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references an antisemitic trope by stating that the claim linking all Jews to Israel's actions is a clear example of antisemitism. This aligns with JDA guidelines B.7 and B.10, which identify such collective responsibilities as antisemitic. The statement essentializes Jews' roles in Israel, a form of racism as per guideline A.1. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA definition."

This example fits within IHRA's definition as it involves targeting a specific group based on their identity and implies discriminatory actions against them. The mention of reinstating citizenship after revocation could be seen as incitement or a form of threat, further reinforcing its antisemitic nature. Therefore, the tweet is deemed antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet targets Jews by stating that their citizenship will be revoked and reinstated, which is a form of collective discrimination. This directly aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as a group. Such statements can be seen as general negative stereotypes about Jewish identity, falling under the category of antisemitic words as outlined in the guidelines."

Someone posted on Facebook and strangers just showing up https://t.co/wVYLDqwgYT,No,"The tweet describes Jewish individuals in Washington, D.C., visiting a mosque during prayer. There's no indication of hatred towards Jews or targeting of Jewish property or community institutions. It does not match any of IHRA's antisemitic examples, such as conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial, or harmful stereotypes. The behavior appears peaceful and unrelated to antisemitism, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitic conduct.",No,"The tweet describes a situation where Jewish individuals are gathered outside a mosque during midday prayers. It notes that someone posted about it on Facebook and mentions strangers appearing. While this may seem unusual, there is no evidence of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. The content does not involve any negative stereotypes, collective responsibility, or other antisemitic behavior. The focus is on the presence of individuals at a mosque rather than targeting Jews or their institutions with hostile intent. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It suggests that Trump and others can't see American Jews as independent individuals but only in relation to Israel, aligning with IHRA's examples of blaming Jewish communities for actions by larger groups. This collective accusation fits the definition of antisemitism targeting Jewish identity through conspiracy-like statements.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that American Jews are merely extensions of Israel, implying a collective loyalty to Israel over their American identity. This reduces Jewish identity to being tied solely to Israel, which aligns with JDA guidelines 7 and 9, as it collectively attributes Jewish individuals' actions to Israel, ignoring their individual identities. Essentializing Jewish identity in this manner violates the guideline's caution against making sweeping negative generalizations about populations. Thus, the tweet reflects antisemitic stereotypes by subsuming American Jews' individuality under Israeli nationalism, meeting JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

This aligns with IHRA's examples of mendacious allegations accusing Jews as a collective of controlling societal institutions, thus constituting antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references ""rich Jews buying Congress,"" which aligns with antisemitic tropes by implying a secret Jewish conspiracy. It targets Jews as a group, holds them collectively responsible for political influence, and uses coded language without overtly anti-Semitic terms but still conveys the stereotype of Jewish control.

This context is theological and does not contain any hateful or stereotypical content directed at Jews. It does not align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which involves negative stereotypes or attacks against Jewish individuals or communities. Therefore, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet quotes John 10:24, which is a passage from the Bible where Jewish people question Jesus. While antisemitism can involve negative stereotypes or attacks against Jews, this context simply presents a religious dialogue without any hateful or demeaning language towards Jews. The use of #Bible and #Hope further indicates a spiritual reference rather than an antisemitic message. Thus, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It employs conspiracy theories and stereotypes, blaming a group for the slaughter of Jews while using inflammatory language that incites hatred, all of which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it employs Holocaust denial (as defined in point 5 of the JDA) by dismissing the slaughter of Jews, aligning it with antisemitic behavior. It also conflates Palestinian Arabs with Nazi support, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes as outlined in points 2 and 7. This conflation and dismissal of historical atrocities fit the criteria for antisemitism, making the tweet harmful and in violation of the JDA guidelines."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as involving mendacious or stereotypical allegations against Jews, dehumanizing them, and blaming them for various issues. The tweet's hateful language and targeting of specific groups, including Jews, fits the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly states that IlhanMN hates Jews, which directly aligns with the JDA definition of antisemitism. It mentions her hating Jews and God, linking her religious identity to objects of hate. Additionally, hating white people and non-Muslims could contribute to a broader context of discrimination, further supporting the antisemitic nature of the statement."

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly those involving stereotypes and the attribution of collective responsibility. By framing the hate as something intrinsic to Jewish identity, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reflects a perception that Jews are targeted for reasons beyond individual actions.",No,"The tweet expresses confusion about non-Jews hating Jewish people and does not contain any statements that align with the criteria outlined in the JDA. It does not involve the application of classical antisemitic stereotypes, deny the existence of Jews, or promote hostility towards them as a group.

The content here is about visibility and cultural identity, not about blaming, attacking, or marginalizing Jews. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit traits of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. It involves a U.S. ambassador encouraging Jews in Germany to wear a kippa and not conceal their identity, which is a positive message aimed at promoting Jewish visibility and pride. This action does not involve any negative stereotypes, hostility, or discrimination against Jews. Instead, it aligns with efforts to combat stigma and encourage Jewish cultural presence.

This behavior aligns with antisemitic principles as it implies discriminatory treatment based on Jewish identity. While the context and intent behind the statement are not explicitly clear, the content itself has the potential to reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish people being unfairly targeted or subjected to inferior standards of care. Antisemitism often manifests in acts that discriminate against individuals based on their ethnicity or religion, which this scenario appears to do. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic behavior as it involves targeting Jewish individuals with harmful actions.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that a Jewish doctor would provide ""the wrong meds"" to Jews, implying discriminatory treatment based on their Jewish identity. According to the JDA, this constitutes discrimination against Jews as Jews, falling under antisemitism. It uses negative stereotypes about Jewish professionals and targets individuals for their ethnicity, aligning with the definition of antisemitism as hostility or prejudice against Jews."

This aligns with IHRA's definition by using symbols and comparisons that reflect anti-Jewish sentiment, thus falling under the scope of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews or promote discrimination against them. While it references antisemitic behavior (neo-Nazis chanting anti-Semitic slogans) and equates such behavior with hatred towards Jews, it is primarily a political critique of Trump's response. According to the JDA guidelines, as long as criticism is based on evidence and not racial discrimination against Jews, it does not constitute antisemitism. The tweet uses antisemitic elements for comparison but does not directly attack or discriminate against Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA definition."

This type of statement perpetuates negative stereotypes by linking Jews to another group, aligning with antisemitic tropes. It could also be seen as an attempt to deny or obscure Jewish heritage, which may contribute to harmful views about the Jewish people. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it can reinforce negative stereotypes and collectively blame Jews for historical events or identity, falling under IHRA's definition of antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet suggests that early Jews were Arabs, which is an incorrect historical assertion. While this statement may carry harmful stereotypes, it does not explicitly target Jews with discrimination or hostility.
