Actually, they should have done it after the last one. https://t.co/BU61pkh27y",No,"The tweet does not exhibit any elements of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It addresses concerns about potential civil rights violations involving Jews but does not involve hateful speech, dehumanization, or stereotypes targeting Jewish individuals. There is no indication of blaming Jews collectively for wrongdoing or promoting negative tropes associated with antisemitism. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being antisemitic according to IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet references the mayor sending cops after Jews, which can be interpreted as a hostile or discriminatory action targeting Jewish individuals. According to the JDA, such actions constitute antisemitism as they involve hostility towards Jews based on their religion. This aligns with guideline 3, which includes examples of antisemitic deeds like assaulting Jewish individuals. The tweet does not fall under the exceptions provided in guidelines B and C, which pertain to specific contexts involving Israel and Palestine. Instead, it directly addresses a scenario where Jews are being targeted by law enforcement actions, fitting the definition of antisemitism as discrimination or hostility against Jews."

While it highlights their rejection of orders and actions taken based on their beliefs, there is no indication of hatred towards Jews or any antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or dehumanizing language. Their actions are presented as a collective response to policy rather than targeting Jewish individuals or community, thus not fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It describes Orthodox Jews opposing Mayor de Blasio's policy by cutting locks to allow their children to play in a park. This action is presented as a rejection of the mayor's social distancing measures, not as an attack on Jewish identity or a stereotype. The content does not involve any racialization of Jews, conspiracy theories, or hostile actions directed at Jews due to their religion. Instead, it focuses on a political stance and conflict regarding public health policies, which is protected speech under human rights instruments and does not constitute antisemitism."

It suggests Jewish manipulation in actions leading to violence against Muslims, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through stereotyping, conspiracy-like accusations, and threats of violence targeting individuals based on religion.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language referring to Jews as ""the pet dog,"" which dehumanizes and demeaningly portrays Jewish people. This aligns with antisemitic principles that reduce Jews to non-human or subordinate roles, thereby fitting the definition provided by the JDA."

Jews wrote the protocols!!!,Yes,"The tweet refers to ""Jews wrote the protocols,"" which are associated with the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion. This assertion promotes conspiracy theories about Jews, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through stereotypical allegations and implying a Jewish collective responsibility for such documents. By invoking these protocols, the tweet contributes to spreading harmful antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories.",Yes,"The tweet references ""the protocols,"" likely referring to the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"" a well-documented antisemitic text. By stating that ""Jews wrote the protocols,"" the tweet promotes the false idea of Jewish conspiracies, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes as defined by the JDA. This attribution links Jews to harmful propaganda, thereby spreading antisemitism. The JDA classifies such statements as antisemitic because they involve racializing and stigmatizing Jews through references to historical antisemitic materials."

This reflects the IHRA definition's examples of mendacious allegations and collective responsibility accusations, making the tweet antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Jews and Blacks are supporting a political party (Democrats) known for oppressing them, which aligns with classic antisemitic tropes. It suggests a negative stereotype about Jewish political support and conflates the Democratic Party with systemic oppression of these groups, potentially linking Jews to conspiracy or exclusionary behavior. This aligns with JDA guidelines on making sweeping generalizations and coded statements that target Jews. Therefore, it qualifies as antisemitic."

This language dehumanizes Jews and constitutes antisemitic rhetoric, regardless of the protest context.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Dirty Jews,"" which is a derogatory slur targeting Jewish people. According to the JDA guidelines, this constitutes verbal antisemitism as it involves negative stereotyping and dehumanization of Jews. Such language falls under antisemitic utterances outlined in guideline 3, even when the context is a protest against racism, as the content itself remains harmful and derogatory. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism according to the JDA definition."

This language is a clear manifestation of antisemitism as defined by IHRA, focusing on hate speech and harmful stereotypes targeting Jewish people. The mention of other groups does not mitigate the antisemitic nature of this statement.",Yes,"The tweet references ""liquidating"" Jews and other groups, invoking language reminiscent of exclusionary and eliminatory sentiments toward Jewish people. This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes that depict Jews as threats to society, warranting their elimination or removal. Such language is considered discriminatory against Jews based on their identity, fulfilling the JDA's definition of antisemitism. The mention of ""appropriating capital"" can also be interpreted as a coded reference to financial power, another antisemitic stereotype. Thus, the tweet reflects antisemitic ideas by targeting Jewish individuals for elimination and associating them with negative financial stereotypes, thereby violating the JDA guidelines against antisemitism."

This statistic could imply discriminatory practices targeting this specific Jewish group, aligning with antisemitic principles as defined by IHRA. The comparison highlights potential unequal treatment of Jewish individuals, suggesting an accusatory stance against them without sufficient context or justification, thereby fitting the criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet refers to a statistical disparity in incarceration rates among Ethiopian Jews in Israel compared to their proportion in society. This statement is factual, detailing a specific social issue without implying any inherent discrimination or negativity towards Jews. It does not involve classical antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or collective blame directed at Jews. Instead, it highlights a socio-economic concern within Israeli society, which falls outside the scope of antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It refers to Jews hearing accusations about their collective responsibility for historical events, which can perpetuate negative stereotypes and foster a hostile environment by blaming Jews for past wrongdoings. This aligns with examples provided by IHRA, such as mendacious allegations against Jewish collectives, reinforcing the perception of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews are being held responsible for historical events as a collective, which aligns with antisemitic tropes that assign Jews a role in past wrongdoings and deny their existence beyond such associations. This violates the JDA's definition of antisemitism by collectively blaming Jews for historical events."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes the use of such harmful stereotypes and reflects a broader antisemitic attitude directed at Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet in question makes a broad negative judgment about all Jews as a group by stating that they are ""some of the meanest people I have ever met."" This generalization targets Jewish individuals based solely on their Jewish identity, reinforcing negative stereotypes and reflecting discrimination against Jews as Jews. According to the JDA, such generalizations can be considered antisemitic as they involve sweeping negative judgments about a population based on their ethnicity or religion."

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes expressions of hatred towards Jews, regardless of context. Therefore, this is considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet ""@robbysoave You hate jews."" directly accuses Robby Soave of hating all Jews, which falls under antisemitism as defined by the JDA. This statement is a generalized negative assertion about an entire ethnic group, aligning with guideline 3, which identifies such utterances as antisemitic. It does not require reference to Israel or any other context, as it directly targets Jews with a negative stereotype. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic."

Imagine if Jews had stayed quiet and Corbyn had won.   What would be happening now?,Yes,"The tweet in question appears to align with certain elements of antisemitism as defined by IHRA. It draws a comparison between Jewish individuals who criticized Corbyn and the current social dynamics, suggesting that their silence would have led to a more favorable outcome. This implies a negative stereotype of Jews as a collective group influencing political processes, which can be seen as dehumanizing or stereotyping. By linking the actions of Jewish people with societal change, the tweet may inadvertently reflect antisemitic undertones, particularly in how it frames Jewish influence as problematic.",Yes,"The tweet in question suggests that if Jewish individuals had remained silent regarding Jeremy Corbyn's political trajectory, certain outcomes would have been more favorable. This implication ties into broader antisemitic stereotypes by framing Jewish intervention as unnecessary or overbearing, which reflects the idea that Jews should not influence political discussions. Such a perspective aligns with the JDA's guidelines against making sweeping generalizations about Jewish involvement in public affairs and can be interpreted as reinforcing harmful antisemitic notions of Jewish control or undue influence. Thus, this tweet crosses the line into antisemitism by invoking stereotypes about Jewish silence in political matters."

It also associates Democrats with terrorism in a context tied to their identity, reinforcing the antisemitic nature of the statement.",Yes,"The tweet incorporates antisemitic elements by referencing Farrakhan's known antisemitic remarks and blaming Jews for hindering aid efforts. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines regarding conspiracy theories and negative stereotypes about Jews, constituting antisemitism."

Hmm.",Yes,"The tweet references instances where prominent figures have called for the end of Israel, which aligns with antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies and control. By highlighting these calls and questioning if similar demands are made against other nations, it reflects a pattern that could be interpreted as antisemitic, targeting Israel as a Jewish collectivity and implying undue influence or conspiracy. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews for global issues or accusing them of controlling societal institutions.",Yes,"The tweet in question advocates for the end of Israel, a Jewish state. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), this constitutes antisemitism as it denies the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish as Jews (B.10). Advocating for the annihilation or dissolution of a Jewish sovereign state is inherently discriminatory against Jews based on their identity, falling under the definition of antisemitism as provided by the JDA guidelines."

Let him know all us Jews know he's a Kapo,Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Kapo,"" which has historical antisemitic connotations, to describe an individual in a way that targets the Jewish community as a collective. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly through mendacious allegations and blaming a group for actions they didn't commit. By associating someone with the term ""Kapo,"" the tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes and undermines the individual's reputation based on their perceived Jewish identity.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Kapo,"" which has a deeply offensive historical connotation linked to the Nazi regime. This term suggests collaboration or betrayal, evoking antisemitic stereotypes by associating the individual with negative actions akin to those during the Holocaust. According to JDA guidelines, such language constitutes antisemitism as it links Jews to evil forces and promotes discrimination. Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic."

It references a video by #JustJews and includes hashtags like #BoardOfDeputies and #ManyJewishVoices, all of which emphasize pluralism within the Jewish community.

It does not contain antisemitic elements such as dehumanizing Jews, denying the Holocaust, or applying stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies. While it may present inaccurate information, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not align with antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. It critically discusses historical events involving Poland and the Soviet Union, focusing on specific military actions and invasions without making any racialized attacks or stereotypes against Jews. While it may present a controversial viewpoint, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the guidelines, such as essentializing groups or linking Jews to evil forces."

This targets Jewish people by implying they are part of a broader group of haters, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it involves expressing hatred towards Jews. By listing Jews among other hated groups and suggesting a gathering place for such hate, the tweet contributes to the perception of Jews being targeted collectively, fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet associates Fox News with individuals who have hostile attitudes towards various groups, including Jews. This aligns with the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, particularly point 3 and point 4, which identify such associations as antisemitic. By grouping together people who hate Jews with others under the pretense of hating Liberals, the tweet implies a connection to negative stereotypes about Jewish people, falling under the definition of coded antisemitism.

Rules seem to be changing fast this year. https://t.co/V9Kex77liL,Yes,"The tweet uses a stereotype (""10-15%"") that falsely implies Jewish individuals have disproportionate control over societal issues, a common antisemitic trope. It also questions whether hating Jews is acceptable, normalizing antisemitism and aligning with IHRA's examples of blaming Jews for societal issues or implying collective responsibility.",Yes,"The tweet raises concerns under the JDA definition of antisemitism. It questions the acceptability of hating Jews, which can normalize antisemitic views by implying that such sentiments are valid or permissible. This aligns with guideline 4, where indirect statements can be antisemitic if they contribute to negative stereotypes or hostility towards Jews. The statement suggests uncertainty about the acceptability of hatred towards Jews, thereby potentially promoting a hostile environment for Jewish individuals. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This reflects antisemitic tendencies by suggesting Jews could be at fault, even innocently, which fits the definition of antisemitism as it involves harmful stereotypes and assumptions about Jewish guilt.",Yes,"The tweet suggests protecting Jews from something they're guilty of nothing. According to JDA guidelines, this could imply a generalized negative stereotype or belief about Jewish influence ( guideline 2), potentially linking them to hidden power or guilt. It might also suggest collective responsibility without fair accusation, aligning with antisemitic tropes of targeting Jews for their identity ( guideline 7). Thus, the tweet's implication of protecting Jews from unfounded accusations could reflect antisemitic sentiment by stereotyping or unfairly burdening Jewish individuals."

It calls for inclusion, learning, and stopping the marginalization of Black Jews. This is a call for social justice and community unity rather than expressing antisemitic sentiments. The content does not involve blaming Jews for conspiracies, denying history, or using stereotypes, which are hallmarks of antisemitism as defined by IHRA. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not reflect antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. It addresses an issue within the Jewish community regarding anti-Black racism, urging fellow Jews to listen and make Black Jews feel welcome.

The content primarily critiques the emphasis on such hate crimes rather than attacking Jews or using stereotypes. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet questions the focus on hate crimes against Jews and implies that such crimes are not as significant as others. This can indirectly suggest that Jewish suffering is less important, aligning with stereotypes and downplaying antisemitic actions, thus fitting the JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

While not overtly harmful on its own, the mention of Jews in a context that could imply special treatment or blame aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly regarding the targeting of Jewish collectives or blaming them for negative outcomes.

It distorts historical facts by stating that 60 million Jews were massacred during the Holocaust, which is a well-documented falsification used to spread Holocaust denialism. Additionally, it uses the term ""jew"" in lowercase, which can be seen as dehumanizing and stereotyping. The question marks at the end imply doubt or skepticism about the widely accepted number of six million Jews killed, further contributing to the antisemitic tone.

This statement is based on a gross distortion and denial of historical facts. The number given is significantly inflated; only approximately 6 million Jews perished during the Holocaust. By using the term ""really"" and questioning the established figures, the tweet exhibits Holocaust denial, which is explicitly antisemitic according to guideline 5 of the JDA. Furthermore, the targeting of Jews as a racial group with false accusations about their suffering during the Holocaust constitutes discrimination against Jews, thereby aligning with the definition of antisemitism.
