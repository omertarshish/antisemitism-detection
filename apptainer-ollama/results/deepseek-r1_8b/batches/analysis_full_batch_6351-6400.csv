This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, such as accusing Jews of conspiracies or targeting them collectively. The use of terms like ""pacify"" suggests an effort to control or subjugate Jewish people, reinforcing negative stereotypes and fitting the definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references ""a fake man built to pacify the Jews,"" which, when interpreted within the context of antisemitic tropes, implies a negative stereotype about Jewish influence and control. This aligns with guideline 2 of the JDA, which highlights the association of Jews with forces of evil or hidden power. The phrase suggests manipulation or control over Jews, fitting the definition of discrimination against Jews as a group, thus qualifying as antisemitic."

KJV Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. NIV   Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing.  Holman Is Jesus forgiving the Jews, or the soldiers?",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as per the IHRA definition. It discusses biblical texts and asks about whom Jesus is forgiving, focusing on the theological context of the crucifixion. There are no elements of hatred towards Jews, conspiracy theories, or offensive stereotypes present in the content. The inquiry is based on religious interpretation rather than any form of antisemitic rhetoric.",No,"The tweet discusses variations in translations of Luke 23:34 and questions whether Jesus is forgiving ""the Jews"" or soldiers.

It correctly highlights the increase in antisemitic hate crimes in NYC, which is a factual matter. While it associates this with Mayor de Blasio's leadership, it does not contain any harmful stereotypes or accusations about Jewish people. Therefore, the content is a report on antisemitic incidents rather than an expression of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet states that approximately 50% of hate crimes in New York City were antisemitic, suggesting a disproportionate targeting of Jewish people. This implies a negative stereotype about Jews being more likely to be targeted, which aligns with the JDA's guidelines on indirect or coded antisemitism by stigmatizing Jewish communities without specific evidence of inherent evil or conspiracies. Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic as it contributes to the perception of Jews as inherently targeted, thus conforming to antisemitic narratives."

While not explicitly hateful, it reinforces stereotypes by comparing Jews to others in a way that could marginalize non-Jews, aligning with antisemitic tropes of Jewish superiority or others' inferiority.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language (""uncivilized animal"") to describe Jews, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination or prejudice against Jews based on their identity. This language dehumanizes and negatively stereotypes Jews, fitting within the framework outlined in the guidelines as examples of antisemitic speech."

I hate people pretending that the US cared about what the Nazis were doing.",Yes,"The tweet implies that the US's motivation for entering World War II was to free Jews, a perspective that aligns with antisemitic stereotypes by suggesting Jewish influence on historical events. This framing reduces the US's actions to being driven by concerns specifically related to Jews, which can be seen as blaming Jews collectively for broader historical outcomes. The use of terms like ""sickening"" and expressing dislike towards those who attribute such motives reinforces a negative perception of Jews, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet contains coded language that implies Jewish concerns were misrepresented as the primary motivator for US actions during WWII. This could reinforce antisemitic stereotypes by suggesting that Jewish issues were exaggerated or used improperly. While not overtly antisemitic, it uses language that downplays Jewish significance and aligns with broader antisemitic narratives, making it fall under the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It employs derogatory terms like ""Jew hater,"" incorporates blood libel stereotypes, and promotes discrimination against Jewish individuals by encouraging others to shun someone based on their supposed hatred of Jews.

It downplays the atrocities associated with Hitler, including the Holocaust, by focusing on economic benefits. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using Nazi comparisons and exoneration of genocidal actions, thus qualifying the tweet as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs language and comparisons that align with antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA definition. By equating oneself to a German in the 1930s while defending Hitler's policies, it trivializes the Holocaust and perpetuates antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish influence.

If you don't believe that you're antisemitic. Period. You don't have to like or agree with the current Israeli government at all but singling out Israel's right to exist is antisemitic.,Yes,"The tweet equates opposition to Zionism with antisemitism by asserting that rejecting the belief in a Jewish state based on indigenous rights constitutes antisemitism. This aligns with IHRA's example of denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, which is classified as antisemitic. Thus, the tweet reflects an antisemitic perspective as it associates criticism of Zionism with antisemitic ideology.",Yes,"The tweet equates opposition to Zionism with antisemitism by stating that denying Israel's existence is antisemitic. According to the JDA, this can be seen as reinforcing the idea that Jews do not have a right to their own state, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes about Jewish presence in the region. Specifically, it links opposing Zionism to antisemitism by implying that those who don't believe in Israel's right to exist are contributing to a hostile stance against Jews as a collective, thereby violating the JDA guidelines."

The average for white American gentiles, 99.",Yes,"The tweet references a disproportionate presence of Ashkenazi Jews in positions of power attributed to higher intelligence, which could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and imply Jewish superiority, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism by associating success with Jewish ethnicity in a ways that stigmatize others.",Yes,"The tweet generalizes that Ashkenazi Jews have higher intelligence and success in power positions, which can be seen as a sweeping negative (or positive) generalization about Jewish people.

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism through mendacious allegations and stereotyping about Jews, targeting their identity rather than just Israel or societal criticism.",Yes,"The tweet uses the phrase ""denial about who the true Jews are"" in a way that implies a negative judgment about others' understanding of Jewish identity. This can be seen as a form of discrimination or prejudice against Jews, as it suggests that the speaker knows who the real Jews are and dismisses others' perceptions. By questioning the legitimacy of Jewish identity, the tweet aligns with the JDA guidelines, which consider such utterances as antisemitic. It doesn't use overt slurs but rather implies a pejorative judgment about Jewish identity, fitting within the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews.

This phrasing suggests that Jews are uniquely entitled to possess or benefit from Israel, which aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, such as accusing Jews of holding a collective responsibility or entitlement over Israel and implying that non-Jews lack such rights. By framing Israel's existence as a unique blessing for Jews, the tweet could be interpreted as excluding others, thus reflecting antisemitic undertones.",No,"The tweet expresses appreciation for the existence of Israel, a Jewish state, and does not contain any antisemitic content, language, or stereotypes.

While it does not explicitly use traditional antisemitic stereotypes or imagery, it implies that being Jewish is a significant factor in evaluating someone negatively.
