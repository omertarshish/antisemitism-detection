It accurately describes events that are well-documented in Holocaust history, such as the role of Chaim Rumkowski and the involvement of Jewish Police and Sonderkommando in deportations. This tweet does not contain any mendacious, dehumanizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews; it is a historical recounting rather than an expression of antisemitic sentiment. Therefore, based on the IHRA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",No,"The tweet discusses historical events from the Holocaust, specifically mentioning the Litzmannstadt ghetto and the quota system for deporting Jews to death camps. It refers to King Chaim Rumkowski, the Sonderkommando, and Jewish Police, detailing their role in the persecution of Jews. While these events are tragic, the tweet does not involve making sweeping generalizations about Jews today or promoting antisemitic ideas. It is a factual recounting of historical atrocities, which falls outside the scope of antisemitism as defined by the JDA, focusing on discrimination against Jews rather than criticism or advocacy against them."

This directly targets Jewish individuals with hateful language, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it involves expressions of hatred towards Jews. Such statements are considered harmful and fall under the category of antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet reports on a pastor's statement that Jews are going to hell, which is a harmful and bigoted view targeting Jewish people. According to the JDA, this type of statement qualifies as antisemitism because it involves making negative generalizations about Jews based on their identity.

Netanyahu is a disgrace to Israel and Her people who deserve better. https://t.co/oMOozM7mue,Yes,"The tweet may be considered antisemitic based on its implication that American Jews are disloyal to their country because they oppose the Israeli government. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly the accusation of dual loyalty or disloyalty, which can perpetuate harmful stereotypes against Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet associates Netanyahu, a Jewish leader, with being a disgrace to Israel and her people. According to the JDA, this can be seen as antisemitic because it holds Jews collectively responsible for their government's actions or criticizes them based on their Jewish identity. By implying that American Jews who care about democracy will not support Netanyahu's leadership, the tweet targets Jewish individuals for their political stance, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism as hostility against Jews as Jews. Thus, this tweet crosses the line into antisemitic territory by collectively blaming a Jewish figure for actions or policies deemed unjust."

Many publically or privately favor a Final Solution",Yes,"The tweet equates the hatred of Jews by certain individuals and groups (referred to as ""Islamicists"") with the virulent antisemitism seen in Nazi Germany during the 1920s and 1930s. It uses the term ""Final Solution,"" which is a direct reference to the Holocaust, a genocide carried out by the Nazis against Jews. The tweet also warns Jews to beware of this hatred, implying a dangerous conspiracy or threat. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves making mendacious allegations and using language that compares contemporary situations to historical genocidal events, thereby spreading harmful stereotypes and fear towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet invokes the term ""Final Solution,"" which directly references the Holocaust, a genocide against Jews. It equates current groups with historical antisemitic movements and promotes hatred towards Jewish people. This aligns with JDA points 2 (linking Jews to evil forces), 5 (denying or minimizing the Holocaust), and 3 (antisemitic speech). The explicit use of harmful terms confirms it as antisemitic."

This implies a negative stereotype about Jews acting aggressively towards non-Jews, aligning with antisemitic ideologies that link Jews to violence and harm. Such statements reinforce harmful stereotypes and can be seen as minimizing the persecution faced by Jews during the Holocaust, thus violating the JDA guidelines on antisemitism."

While it points out the absence of Jewish identity in the scene, the critique is more about cultural representation and exclusion rather than specifically targeting Jews with harmful stereotypes or antisemitic intent. The focus is on the absence of various groups, making it less about antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which requires a specific targeting of Jews based on negative perceptions or hostility.",No,"The tweet expresses concern about a nativity scene excluding certain groups, including Jews. While antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as Jews, this exclusion seems to focus on the composition of the scene rather than targeting Jews specifically. The JDA guidelines don't indicate that excluding these groups from a nativity scene constitutes antisemitism, as it doesn't involve classical stereotypes or attacks on Jews. Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the provided definition."

This language can be seen as dehumanizing and aligns with antisemitic tropes, such as blaming Jewish people for societal issues or implying conspiratorial behavior. The mention of both progressive left and alt-right groups highlighting this reflects an antisemitic narrative where different political groups converge on a negative perception of Jews. Thus, the tweet adheres to IHRA's definition of antisemitism by stereotyping and negatively implying Jewish behavior.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""DASTARDLY JEWS,"" which describes Jewish people with a negative and derogatory connotation, falling under the category of antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

It criticizes someone's stance on Israel and aligns it with antisemitism, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. This includes making mendacious allegations about Jews as a collective and accusing them of conspiring against others, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet can be interpreted as targeting Jewish individuals for their political stance on Israel, using language that implies disloyalty and connects their support with antisemitism. This aligns with JDA guidelines 7 and 10, which consider treating Jews collectively responsible because of their identity or denying their right to exist as antisemitic actions. The tweet's tone and implications suggest a hostile attitude towards Jewish individuals, based on their political views, making it antisemitic according to the provided definition."

It does not involve any discrimination against Jews as a group or the application of classical antisemitic stereotypes. Instead, it provides a factual description of the deception faced by Jews deported to Auschwitz during the Holocaust. While guideline 5 mentions that denying or minimizing the Holocaust is antisemitic, this tweet does not deny or minimize the event but rather acknowledges historical atrocities.

By associating certain people with hatred of Jews, it aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes dehumanizing or stereotypical accusations against Jewish groups. While the tweet doesn't explicitly advocate harm, its generalized association of a group with hating Jews falls into the category of antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly states that certain individuals ""hate the Jews,"" which directly targets Jewish people as a group. According to the JDA, this is an example of verbal antisemitism (see guideline A3). The term ""hate the Jews"" reflects prejudice against Jewish identity and constitutes discrimination against Jews as Jews, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. This statement does not fit into the examples provided under non-antisemitic categories, such as supporting Palestinian rights or criticizing Zionism, and instead directly attacks Jewish people in a discriminatory manner."

These terms dehumanize the group by reducing them to negative stereotypes. According to the JDA, this kind of language can be considered antisemitic because it aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that devalue Jewish people. The tweet does not explicitly mention Jews but uses language that has historically been associated with antisemitic beliefs, making it a form of coded or indirect antisemitism. By dehumanizing the group, it facilitates inhumane treatment, as noted in the guidelines. Thus, this tweet violates the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This linking of historical context with a critique of Jewish safety could perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jews, aligning with classical antisemitic themes. Specifically, guidelines 2 and 3 highlight the association of Jews with evil forces and the application of antisemitic symbols to Israel's history (guidelines B(6) and (7)).

This implies a stereotype that all American Jews are antisemitic and targets them collectively based on their religion. It aligns with IHRA's definition by blaming an entire group for imagined wrongdoing and expressing prejudice against Jews, which fits the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet discriminates against American Jews by suggesting their exclusion from Israel based on a stereotype that they are antisemitic. This is an example of direct antisemitism where Jewish identity is used to justify exclusionary policies. It treats antisemitism as an inherent characteristic of all American Jews, which is an essentializing generalization. Additionally, it applies classical antisemitic tropes by associating Jews with negativity and using antisemitism as a coded or explicit reason for exclusion.

The use of the term ""Nazi school"" is particularly concerning, as it equates NYU to an institution associated with severe harm and discrimination against Jews.
