This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes statements that convey a collective negative attitude towards Jews. The use of ""hate"" without specific context suggests animosity towards Jewish individuals, fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior as outlined in the examples provided.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses the word ""hate"" directed at individuals identified by their Jewish identity. According to the JDA, this constitutes antisemitism as it involves hostility against Jews simply because of their Jewishness. While the tweet does not specify particular characteristics or actions, the use of ""hate"" implies a form of discrimination against the Jewish group, aligning with the definition provided. Therefore, the statement is identified as antisemitic."

This is a classic example of antisemitic conspiracy theory and stereotyping, as it falsely blames Jews for heinous acts. According to IHRA's definition, this type of rhetoric falls under antisemitism because it involves demonizing and dehumanizing Jews by falsely accusing them of such actions. Blood libel is one of the examples provided in IHRA's list of contemporary manifestations of antisemitism, particularly when used to characterize Jewish individuals or communities. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet ""Absolute blood libel against Jews..."" contains the term ""blood libel,"" which refers to the false accusation that Jews use Christian children's blood in rituals. This is a well-documented and serious form of antisemitism, as it not only stigmatizes Jews but also has a history of inciting violence. According to the JDA, antisemitism includes discrimination against Jews as Jews and can manifest through explicit forms like this example. The use of ""blood libel"" directly ties into classical antisemitic tropes and thus falls under the definition of antisemitism provided by the JDA."

Again, the �others� are neglected to be honored.",No,"The tweet expresses frustration over an article's focus on Jewish deaths while neglecting non-Jewish victims. While it highlights a bias against acknowledging non-Jewish suffering, it does not directly exhibit hatred towards Jews or use antisemitic stereotypes. Thus, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not directly express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. While it critiques historical narratives and suggests that non-Jewish victims are neglected, it doesn't perpetuate classical antisemitic stereotypes, use coded language, or deny the Holocaust.

It emphasizes inclusivity by celebrating different Jewish identities without making harmful accusations or using stereotypes. This aligns with promoting understanding rather than antisemitism, as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet discusses the recognition of various Jewish groups within Israel and asserts their connection to Israel. While it addresses inclusivity, it does not contain any language that reflects antisemitic stereotypes, denies the existence of Jewish groups, or collectively holds Jews responsible in a harmful way.

This targeting of Jewish individuals based on their religion constitutes an antisemitic action under the IHRA definition. It aligns with examples such as blaming or targeting Jewish people collectively for actions, which is a form of antisemitism. Furthermore, it describes a criminal act where individuals are targeted because they are Jewish, fitting the antisemitic criteria outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that New York City’s mayor has ordered the rounding up of Jews, which reflects a conspiracy theory or discrimination targeting Jewish individuals based on their ethnicity. This aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA, specifically those involving racialized persecution and conspiracy theories about Jewish people. Such actions can incite fear and harm, making the tweet a clear instance of antisemitism."

The violence is largely fueled by the left and #openborders. https://t.co/HEywZHqp1Z,Yes,"The tweet describes antisemitic acts by stating that Jews feel the need to hide their Judaism due to antisemitic violence in Europe. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes targeting Jewish individuals and forcing them to conceal their identity, a direct manifestation of antisemitic behavior. Additionally, while the tweet attributes the violence to political groups, it does not explicitly clarify that this is done to harm Jews as a people or promote antisemitic stereotypes. The primary issue lies in the initial statement about hiding Judaism due to violence, which constitutes antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet states that Jews in Europe feel the need to hide their Judaism due to antisemitic violence, attributing this rise to the left and open borders. According to the JDA, this constitutes hostility towards Jews as Jews. Antisemitism is defined as discrimination or hostility against Jews specifically for being Jewish. Hiding one's Judaism reflects a hostile environment directed at Jews based on their faith, aligning with the definition of antisemitism as described in the guidelines."

His Real Last Name is actually. �WILHELM.� Interesting. https://t.co/4mECxqKrFz",Yes,"The tweet employs several elements that align with antisemitic tropes and rhetoric as defined by IHRA. It associates Mayor Bill De Blasio, a Jewish individual, with threatening to round up Jews, referencing Nazi Germany's actions during the Holocaust, which is a deeply offensive and harmful stereotype. Additionally, it plays on his last name in a manner that evokes the antisemitic symbol of ""Wilhelm"" (a variation of ""Willhelm""), reminiscent of Adolf Hitler. The tweet also contrasts De Blasio's positive action toward Muslims with a negative implication towards Jews, reinforcing a narrative that Jewish people are targets for harm or blame. This combination of language and imagery clearly targets Jewish people, fitting the criteria of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet in question explicitly threatens to round up Jews, a direct reference to historical antisemitic actions such as those during the Holocaust. While Mayor Bill De Blasio is Jewish, the threat implies collective responsibility for Jewish people based on their ethnicity, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. The statement uses a real event (providing free meals) to segue into a harmful stereotype, indicating hostility towards Jews as a group. This constitutes discrimination and prejudice against Jews, fitting the criteria of antisemitism as defined."

It refers to ""Jews"" in a context that praises their contributions and achievements alongside others, without employing any hateful or stereotypical language. There is no indication of blame, conspiracy theories, or other antisemitic elements, and it does not target Jewish individuals negatively. Instead, it seems to be a compliment acknowledging their innovative capabilities.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Jews"" in conjunction with ""infidels,"" which might imply a stereotypical or generalizing view of Jewish capability. While not explicitly derogatory, it could be interpreted as making a negative assumption about Jews based on race or religion, falling under antisemitic guidelines that prohibit sweeping negative generalizations."

It equates Trump with Mengele in a derogatory manner, associating him with genocidal behavior towards Jews. This linking of another person to a known antisemitic figure, while demeaning them, spreads hatred by implication towards Jewish people, thus aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references Dr. Josef Mengele's atrocities against Jews during the Holocaust, directly linking his actions to Jewish people. This aligns with the JDA guidelines by associating Jews with a negative historical event, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes and hostility towards Jews.

With socialism on the rise beware. We will see more of this. #StandWithIsrael https://t.co/pdcnLy2sSx,Yes,"The tweet mentions a Spanish parade mocking the Holocaust and refers to the death of 6 million Jews, which directly relates to antisemitic content. Mocking the Holocaust is considered antisemitic as it trivializes the atrocities and denies the historical reality, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. Additionally, the reference to socialism on the rise and a warning about more such displays could be seen as a broader concern, but the core issue lies in the explicit mocking of the Holocaust. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic expression.",Yes,"The tweet directly references a Spanish parade that mocks the Holocaust and the six million Jews who died, which is an explicit targeting of Jews. Additionally, it links this behavior to socialism rising, implying a broader antisemitic stereotype about Jewish influence tied to political causes.

The Jews respect themselves,Yes,"The tweet references Adolf Hitler, a Nazi leader associated with antisemitism and the Holocaust. While it also mentions that ""The Jews respect themselves,"" the inclusion of Adolf Hitler's name in the context of discussing Jews can be interpreted as targeting Jewish people collectively, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. This is especially considering the potential to perpetuate negative stereotypes or hate speech, even if the intent isn't overtly harmful. The combination of referencing a Nazi leader with a statement about Jews makes it conducive to spreading antisemitic ideology, thus falling under the IHRA criteria.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit any elements of antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It makes a factual statement correcting misinformation about a foundation named after Adolf Hitler and affirmatively states that Jews respect themselves, which is a positive observation rather than an expression of discrimination or hostility against Jews.

This targeting of Jewish individuals for speaking out fits the IHRA definition by denigrating their collective presence and silencing their voices, which aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by intimidating or marginalizing Jewish people in public discourse.",Yes,"The tweet targets British Jews directly, using hostile language (""shut up"") and implies that their voices are unwelcome. This aligns with antisemitic criteria such as targeting Jews for their identity (B7) and expressing hostility (B3). It attempts to suppress Jewish expression, fitting under A1's discrimination against a specific population. The specificity towards British Jews and the nature of the demand for silence reinforce the antisemitic nature of the statement."

This implies a negative judgment based on Jewish identity, aligning with IHRA's criteria of dehumanizing or discriminatory remarks directed at Jews as a group.

This language implies that killing Jews is being incentivized or rewarded, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by promoting harmful stereotypes and dehumanizing Jews. It also reflects the notion of blaming a Jewish group for actions that bring rewards, which fits the category of antisemitic behavior as outlined in the IHRA examples. The tweet contributes to a negative perception of Jews by associating their deaths with rewards, thereby reinforcing antisemitic ideology.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that the Palestinian Authority rewards individuals for killing Jews, which glorifies violence against Jewish people.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using harmful stereotypes to demean or attack Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet invokes a classic antisemitic stereotype by linking Jews to pigs, a long-standing prejudiced belief. It uses this association to mock Muslims who hate Jews, suggesting an inconsistency in their Imam's explanation of Jewish dietary practices.

This aligns with antisemitic tropes where Jews are blamed for issues. Specifically, guideline B.10 is relevant as it addresses denying the rights of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish as Jews.
