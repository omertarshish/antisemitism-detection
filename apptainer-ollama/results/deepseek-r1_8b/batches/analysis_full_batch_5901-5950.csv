The Bible in Genesis 12:3 says those that curse the Jews will be cursed. De Blasio is cursed a horrible curse according to God�s Word https://t.co/KjAtvaDYUF,Yes,"The tweet uses a biblical reference to imply that Mayor De Blasio is cursed because he allegedly hates Jews. This involves invoking religious text to demean and stereotype Jews, aligning with antisemitic tropes that dehumanize Jewish people. The statement goes beyond criticism of Israel or Jews by asserting a direct curse on an individual based on perceived hatred towards Jews, which fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet targets Mayor De Blasio for his perceived hate towards Jews, directly associating him with antisemitic behavior by referencing Genesis 12:3, a verse often used in antisemitic contexts. This links Jewish identity to negativity and curses, meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

It suggests that the NYPD is targeting Jews and criticizes de Blasio in a way that implies Jewish ambition or negative leadership qualities, aligning with harmful stereotypes and false accusations about Jewish collectivities. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes verbal attacks and Nazi comparisons that target Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly targets Jewish individuals by mentioning ""Jews"" in the context of being subjected to NYPD action. It compares Bill de Blasio's actions to those of Adolf Hitler, evoking the Holocaust and associating Jews with harm and oppression. This direct comparison and the use of language linking Jews to historical atrocities aligns with antisemitic principles as defined by the JDA, which includes discrimination against Jews and the use of negative stereotypes or comparisons that stigmatize Jewish people. Therefore, this tweet is deemed antisemitic."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination against Jewish individuals or religious groups, potentially reinforcing stereotypes about treatment of non-Muslims.",Yes,"The tweet describes an incident where Jews are excluded from entering a public event. This exclusion targets Jews specifically based on their religious identity, which constitutes discrimination and prejudice against them as Jews. According to JDA guidelines A(3), making negative generalizations or excluding individuals based on religion can be considered antisemitic. Here, the exclusion of Jews (and possibly Christians) from a public event exemplifies discriminatory behavior towards Jews, fitting the definition of antisemitism as it involves hostility towards Jews as a group. This aligns with the guidelines outlined in JDA, specifically under A(3), which addresses such forms of discrimination and prejudice."

This links Jewish influence with negative outcomes, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes where Jews are seen as having undue power over society.

The structure of the tweet, along with symbols and unclear text, suggests an attempt to dehumanize or stereotype the Jewish community, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. The content could be interpreted as implying that Jews have hidden influence over societal institutions, a common antisemitic trope. Therefore, based on the context and structure, this tweet is considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet employs encoded language and symbolic characters that have historically been associated with antisemitic stereotypes and imagery. According to JDA guidelines, particularly B.3, the use of such symbols constitutes an antisemitic manifestation. The inclusion of these elements, which are often used to promote harmful stereotypes or coded messages targeting Jews, aligns with the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jewish people or their institutions.

While the statement aims to correct a stereotype, the use of this term contributes to antisemitic rhetoric by reinforcing negative perceptions of non-Jews as inferior or there to be feared. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes dehumanizing language and negative stereotypes about Jews or non-Jews, particularly when they target individuals based on their identity.",Yes,"The tweet uses the derogatory term ""goyim"" to refer to non-Jews and asserts that Jews are not out to harm them. This reinforces negative stereotypes where Jews are seen as superior or having special knowledge, aligning with classic antisemitic ideas of Jewish conspiracies or superiority. The use of Yiddish terminology adds a layer of coded language that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, fitting the JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, especially regarding accusations against a Jewish group based on their beliefs or actions, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories.",Yes,"The tweet references 1.8 million Haredim Jews and their purported statements, potentially stereotyping or negatively generalizing about this group. If the linked content applies antisemitic stereotypes to Haredim, particularly in relation to Israel, it aligns with JDA guidelines that classify such behavior as antisemitic. This includes collective responsibility or negative portrayals based on Jewish identity, falling under points 7 and 10 of the JDA, which define such actions as discriminatory and hostile towards Jews. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic."

It does not contain any content that targets Jewish individuals with hatred or negative stereotypes. The verse is interpreted as a message of togetherness rather than antisemitism.",No,"The tweet quotes a Bible passage that discusses spiritual unity, emphasizing that both Jews and Gentiles are part of one body through baptism into the Spirit. This passage does not promote any negative stereotypes about Jews or reflect classical antisemitic themes. It instead focuses on religious unity without targeting Jewish people in a discriminatory manner. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic."

This is a direct and harmful expression that targets Jewish individuals and involves violence, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it includes manifestations that harm Jewish communities. The language used incites violence and reflects a hatred towards Jews, fulfilling the criteria outlined by IHRA. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for being antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet directly calls for the murder of Jews, which is an explicit act of hostility and discrimination against Jewish individuals.

Whereas you apparently have Stockholm syndrome or some shit.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Stockholm syndrome"" to describe Jewish voters who support a particular political party. This implies a stereotype that associates Jewish individuals with a psychological condition, which can be seen as antisemitic. The IHRA definition of antisemitism includes making stereotypical allegations about Jews as a group, and this example fits by linking Jewish identity with a negative trait. Additionally, it suggests that Jewish loyalty to a political party is excessive or abnormal, reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jewish people. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemiticism.",Yes,"The tweet discriminates against American Jews by grouping them into stereotypes based on political affiliations. It uses derogatory language (""some shit"") to dismiss one group, reflecting hostility towards Jews as a collective, thereby conforming to the JDA's antisemitic criteria."

This statement does not target Jewish people as a group, nor does it contain any antisemitic elements such as stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or collective blame. It appears to be about political discourse rather than targeting Jewish identity. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic."

This implies a stereotypical accusation that Jews are collectively responsible for or have a specific stance on this issue, which aligns with antisemitic rhetoric by blaming a group for societal issues. The mention of Jews in this context could be seen as using Jewish identity to stigmatize or harm them, fitting the IHRA's definition of antisemitism through collective accusations and harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses language that targets Jewish people by suggesting they are collectively responsible for addressing or silencing on a specific issue. It connects Jews to a controversial narrative about white girls and rape privilege, implying criticism of their silence.

It attributes societal issues, such as the pandemic, to the Jewish community, aligning with antisemitic tropes that scapegoat Jews. By connecting Mayor De Blasio's criticism of this group to the pandemic, it reinforces negative stereotypes and collectively blames Jews for external problems, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language targeting Jewish people (""stupid Jews,"" ""morons"") and connects their identity to the spread of COVID-19, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes. This directly contradicts the JDA's definition by applying negative generalizations based on Jewish identity, thus qualifying as antisemitic."

Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet discusses a political meeting between two Israeli politicians regarding the formation of a coalition.

However, Jews need their homeland which is no worse or better than other nations. I believe in the Torah promises (and sanctions).",Yes,"The tweet contains multiple elements that align with antisemitic rhetoric. It dehumanizes Soros by calling him a ""pig"" and accuses Jewish banking families (Rothschilds) and Zionists of abusing nations, which reflects harmful stereotypes about Jewish control and influence. Additionally, it suggests that Jews' self-determination (via Israel) is equivalent to or negative compared to other nations, contributing to the antisemitic narrative. The mention of Torah promises and sanctions further ties into a belief system that could be seen as entitlement or exclusionary behavior towards non-Jews, supporting broader antisemitic tropes. Thus, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet uses antisemitic language by referring to Soros as a ""pig,"" which demeans him based on his Jewish heritage. It also invokes the Rothschild Zionists trope, a classic antisemitic conspiracy theory. While the statement about Jews needing their homeland may seem neutral, it aligns with antisemitic views of Jewish collective power and control. The inclusion of Torah promises and sanctions further ties into religious stereotypes. Thus, the tweet adheres to the JDA's definition of antisemitism by embodying derogatory language and harmful stereotypes towards Jews."

Cahill: The Gifts Of The Jews,Yes,"The tweet ""Cahill: The Gifts Of The Jews"" could be interpreted as antisemitic based on the IHRA definition. The phrase suggests that Jews possess gifts which are being used negatively or manipulatively, potentially playing into stereotypes about Jewish influence or conspiracies. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly those involving dehumanizing accusations against a Jewish group, thus warranting a classification as antisemitic.",No,"The title ""The Gifts Of The Jews"" alone does not provide sufficient context to determine if the tweet is antisemitic. While it mentions gifts, which could be neutral or positive, without knowing how it's framed or if it includes harmful stereotypes, we cannot conclusively label it as antisemitic. Antisemitism often involves negative generalizations or stereotypes, so the content of the article is crucial to assess whether it crosses into such territory."

It uses the term ""goy,"" which is a pejorative Yiddish word for non-Jew, to demean and mock a non-Jewish individual in a context that involves Jews being falsely accused. Additionally, it references 12 Jews in a scenario that implies their involvement in an event where they were not actually present, reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish individuals or groups being collectively responsible for false accusations. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly the tendency to hold Jews collectively accountable for real or imagined wrongdoing and the use of derogatory language targeting Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet contains elements that align with antisemitic criteria as defined by the JDA. It uses the term ""goy,"" which is derogatory toward non-Jews, and generalizes negatively about Jews in a context that could reflect antisemitic stereotypes.

It collectively implicates all Jews, promoting a harmful stereotype that targets the Jewish community as a group.

This statement is highly threatening and discriminatory, directly targeting Jewish individuals based on their religion. It evokes historical atrocities such as the Holocaust, which is explicitly mentioned in the JDA guidelines as antisemitic.

Additionally, other statements about human rights issues are secondary but the mention of war on Jews is sufficient to classify the tweet as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet discusses Iran's treatment of various groups, including Jews, and notes Democrats' silence on these issues. While it mentions the war against Jews, this is part of a broader critique of Democrats' inaction on multiple human rights concerns.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes conspiracy theories targeting Jewish people. The mention of instructing Jews and the use of Islamic references without context could perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jews collectively being controlled or misled. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it reflects a perception that Jews are being influenced by an external entity in a harmful manner.",Yes,"The tweet references Dajjal, an eschatological figure from Islamic tradition associated with the Antichrist, implying that Jewish people are being manipulated or controlled. This links Jews collectively to a negative, malevolent force, which aligns with classic antisemitic stereotypes of Jews being connected to evil or conspiratorial actions (JDA guidelines 2 and 3).

This invocation ties into antisemitic rhetoric by associating Jews with atrocities committed during the Holocaust. Additionally, the tweet targets individuals who support or idolize Nazis, thereby indirectly attacking Jewish people through association with harmful ideologies.

This comparison can be seen as dehumanizing and stereotyping, aligning with IHRA's examples of using language that mirrors classical antisemitism or draws Nazi analogies. Additionally, the tweet suggests that Jews should reject this plan, reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish collective responsibility for actions of their state. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitic expression as per IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Apartheid Plan"" associated with Trump's policies towards Israel. According to the JDA guidelines, applying classical antisemitic tropes or negative stereotypes to Israel can be considered antisemitic (see points B6 and B7). The use of the term ""apartheid,"" which is inherently racialized and discriminatory, suggests a connection to antisemitic notions of Jewish control and domination. By equating Israeli policies with a form of systemic discrimination and urging rejection through a hashtag targeting Jews and allies, the tweet collectively implicates Jewish people in supporting such practices, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes. Thus, this approach conforms to classical antisemitic language and should be deemed as such under the JDA definition."
