Why pity those who have none?,Yes,"The tweet suggests that if Palestinians were to take control of all of Palestine, Jews would have to leave, implying a displacement or exclusion based on Jewish identity. This targets Jews collectively and reinforces stereotypes about their place in Palestinian society, aligning with antisemitic rhetoric as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language that aligns with antisemitic tropes outlined by the JDA. Specifically, it implies that when Palestinians take control of Palestine, Jews must leave, reinforcing the idea that Jewish people are not entitled to exist there. This directly targets Jews as a group and reflects the classical antisemitic stereotype of Jewish expulsion or exclusion. The statement also fails to recognize the legitimate rights of Jewish individuals in the region, which is covered under point 10 of the JDA guidelines. Therefore, the tweet is found to be antisemitic as it discriminates against Jews based on their ethnicity."

This suggests that Omar is being criticized for acting against someone Jewish, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. The implication is that her actions are directed at a Jew, potentially due to his Jewish identity, rather than based on objective reasoning. This reflects the stereotyping and blaming of Jews for negative actions, fitting the examples provided by IHRA of antisemitic behavior. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it involves targeting Jewish individuals in a harmful context.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Congresswoman Omar ""targeting Jews,"" specifically Stephen Miller. This suggests that Jews, particularly those with links to Israel, are being held responsible or treated unfavorably due to their identity. According to JDA guidelines B.7 and B.6, this aligns with antisemitic tropes where Jews are collectively blamed for actions associated with Israel. The explicit targeting of a Jewish individual (Stephen Miller) in a political context constitutes antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

The statement justifies antisemitism by suggesting that Jews collectively ""did this to themselves,"" which is a form of victim-blaming and reflects antisemitic ideology.",Yes,"The tweet aligns with antisemitic tropes by suggesting that Jews and Israel are responsible for the dislike or hate directed towards them.

This direct linkage aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes attributing negative qualities to Jews or their institutions.

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly the false accusation that Jews are conspiring to harm others or keep them oppressed.",Yes,"The tweet targets specific Jewish organizations by implying they would prefer Jews to remain enslaved in Egypt, thereby opposing Jewish self-determination.

This misuse of terminology trivializes the Holocaust, an act of antisemitism by denying its gravity. Furthermore, associating Jews with actions that mirror oppressive behavior (via the hashtag #JewsAgainstICE) reinforces harmful stereotypes about Jewish involvement in radical or disruptive activities. Thus, this tweet adheres to IHRA's definition of antisemitism through both Holocaust trivialization and negative stereotyping.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Elizabeth Concentration Camp,"" which incorrectly refers to a concentration camp and evokes the tragic history of the Holocaust, a central aspect of antisemitic ideology.

This comparison reduces a complex historical atrocity to a political criticism, potentially trivializing the severity of the Holocaust while demonizing Trump. IHRA defines antisemitism as dehumanizing Jews or blaming them for harm, which this tweet does by associating a political figure with such atrocities, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet expresses concern over a comparison made by the user, not an attack on Jewish people or Jewish institutions. While sensitive, the comparison is used to critique a political figure rather than target Jews. The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews, which this tweet does not do.

This reflects anti-Semitic undertones by marginalizing Jewishness and potentially reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish loyalty and self-determination.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jewish individuals must either convert to Christianity or move to Israel, linking their identity to specific actions. This implies a form of coercion and ties Jewish identity to demands that could reinforce negative stereotypes. It discriminates against Jews by suggesting they must conform to certain political or religious outcomes based on their ethnicity or faith.

While it mentions a political stance by Jewish individuals, it does not exhibit any elements of antisemitism as defined by IHRA. It neither promotes hate towards Jews nor uses harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories. The statement simply reflects differing political views and is not intended to incite hatred or discrimination against Jews.",No,"The tweet states that many American Jews do not support Netanyahu. This statement reflects a political difference of opinion within the Jewish community regarding Netanyahu's policies or leadership. According to the JDA, antisemitism involves discriminatory attitudes or hostility directed at Jews as Jews, such as applying classical stereotypes, holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions, or denying their right to exist as Jews in Israel. Here, the tweet does not exhibit any of these traits; instead, it discusses political support within a specific demographic, which is protected under free speech and does not constitute antisemitism."

This statement targets the Jewish community by implying disloyalty or primary allegiance outside their nation, reinforcing stereotypes and potentially dehumanizing Jewish citizens collectively. Therefore, it fits within the definition of antisemitism as provided by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet assumes that American Jews are inherently more loyal to Israel than the United States, which is a sweeping generalization that reduces their identity to loyalty. According to the JDA guidelines, specifically guideline B9, this assumption treats non-Israeli Jews as necessarily more loyal to Israel than their own countries, which can be seen as antisemitic discrimination against Jews for being Jewish. The statement reflects classical antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish loyalty and disloyalty, thus aligning with the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews."

The mention of British, American, and Israeli Jews celebrating is in the context of their opposition to Corbyn, not stigmatizing them based on their Jewish identity.

While the intent may not be explicit hatred, the language used reflects broader stereotypes and negative views, fitting the definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Jewish voters have predictable voting habits because of their Jewish identity. This reduces their political choices to something inherent, potentially reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish loyalty or control. By linking their identity to voting behavior, it aligns with coded antisemitic language that suggests an underlying motive related to being Jewish, which can be seen as dismissive or negative towards Jewish individuals' autonomy in political decisions. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it ties Jewish identity to predictable voting patterns, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes."

Third, it falsely accuses Jews of undue influence over policies, blaming an entire group for societal issues.

While the tweet also mentions Ilhan Omar's identity, this appears to be an attempt to shift focus rather than target her specifically. The primary content is the reference to the chant, which fits the IHRA definition as it involves targeting Jewish individuals with harmful rhetoric. Additionally, the mention of ""very fine people"" could imply a downplay or normalization of the antisemitic act, and the criticism of someone's silence suggests an indifferent attitude towards the issue, further indicating the presence of antisemitic elements.
