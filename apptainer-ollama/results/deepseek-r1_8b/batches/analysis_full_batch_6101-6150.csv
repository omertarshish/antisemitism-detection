This statement targets Jewish people by suggesting they have undue control over societal institutions, aligning with the recognized harmful stereotypes and conspiracy theories associated with antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet includes the statement about ""how jews control the media,"" which aligns with the antisemitic stereotype of Jews having hidden power over various aspects of society. This directly references a classic antisemitic belief, falling under guideline A(2) and B(6), thereby making it antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, the content does not involve any hateful rhetoric or actions directed at Jewish individuals or communities. Instead, it highlights a positive and inclusive gesture by a Jewish group, which aligns with broader societal values of unity and commemoration. None of the criteria for antisemitism are met here, as the tweet is unrelated to any negative perceptions or harmful stereotypes about Jewish people.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit any elements of antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

This phrase reflects a negative stereotype about Jews by implying they are a threat or danger, aligning with examples provided in the IHRA guidelines that consider such language as antisemitic. Therefore, the inclusion of this phrase makes the tweet meet the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet includes the phrase ""Beware of Jews,"" which directly targets Jews with a negative stereotype. According to the JDA guidelines, this constitutes discrimination and prejudice against Jews as Jews, fulfilling the definition of antisemitism. While other parts of the tweet discuss political issues like communism and defunding the police, the explicit mention of Jews in a stereotypical context is significant enough to classify the statement as antisemitic. The NBA's custom jersey design featuring ""Beware of Jews"" adds to this characterization, aligning with guideline 3's examples of negative stereotypes. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism."

It also references polygamy, potentially associating Hindus with practices stereotypically linked to other groups, including Jews. This reductionist comparison can reinforce antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish demographics and influence, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through the use of mendacious allegations and demographic targeting.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that associates Hindu women's reproductive choices with those of Israeli Jews, suggesting that Hindus need to have four or five children, referencing an ""Islamic harem."" This comparison reduces the personal choices of Hindu women to a stereotype linked with another group (Israeli Jews). Such generalizations and comparisons, which can imply negative characteristics or discrimination against a particular population, align with antisemitic principles as defined by the JDA. Specifically, it essentializes and makes sweeping judgments about Hindus based on their reproductive practices, reminiscent of classical antisemitic tropes that link certain groups to negative stereotypes. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic."

They were turned away at ports, put in prisons, called invaders.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses language that downplays and dismisses the historical context of Jewish immigration to Britain, referring to Jewish individuals as ""invaders"" and questioning their arrival methods. This reflects antisemitic stereotypes by implying a collective responsibility or unwelcome status of Jewish people, aligning with IHRA's definition of hate speech targeting Jews.",Yes,"The tweet describes Jewish immigration to Britain during the Nazi era in a way that implies they were unwelcome and casts them as invaders. This aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes about Jews being outsiders or unwanted, which falls under the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

This directly targets Jews by invoking historical atrocities associated with antisemitism. Using such comparisons to demean someone aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes verbal attacks that degrade Jewish people or communities. The use of Nazi references in this context is harmful and falls under the umbrella of antisemitic rhetoric, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet compares an individual's actions or situation to the Nazis' extermination of Jews and burning of books, which are severe examples of antisemitic rhetoric. This comparison links Jewish people to one of the most traumatic historical events, thereby perpetuating a harmful stereotype that demeans and discriminates against Jews. Such language falls under the definition of antisemitism as it involves hostility towards Jewish individuals by associating them with evil forces or tragic historical events, even if done humorously. It also aligns with guideline 2, which highlights the tendency to link Jews with negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories, and guideline 5, which criminalizes Holocaust denial or minimization. Thus, this tweet violates the JDA's antisemitism definition."

This statement can be interpreted as implying that Ethiopian Jews are more likely to engage in criminal activity, which aligns with negative stereotypes and dehumanizing accusations about Jewish groups. By pointing out this disparity without providing context or acknowledging potential systemic factors, the tweet risks reinforcing harmful antisemitic tropes. The IHRA definition considers such actions antisemitic when they involve blaming a specific group for societal issues or applying negative stereotypes, making this tweet fit that criteria.",No,"The tweet provides a statistical comparison regarding the incarceration rates of Ethiopian Jewish individuals in Israel relative to their population proportion. While this information could potentially be misused to imply negative stereotypes, the tweet itself does not explicitly contain antisemitic content, nor does it directly link this statistic to a broader conspiracy or negative judgment about Jews. As per the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, which isn't apparent in this context. Therefore, the tweet doesn't qualify as antisemitic under the given definition."

Why again did you oppose the House resolution against antisemitism?",No,"The tweet references the Holocaust to critique someone's stance on antisemitism but doesn't deny, trivialize, or use stereotypes related to Jews. It leverages historical events for political argument without targeting Jewish people directly, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet references the Holocaust in a way that invokes antisemitic tropes by equating opposition to an antisemitism resolution with genocide. While it doesn't deny the Holocaust, it uses its horror to attack a political stance, thus aligning with JDA guidelines that consider such misuse as antisemitic.

It targets ""the Jews"" as a collective, which aligns with antisemitic rhetoric that often stereotypes or collectively blames Jewish people for various issues. Without context, this phrasing could reinforce negative stereotypes or imply blame, fitting into IHRA's examples of antisemitism, such as accusing a group of wrongdoing based on collective identity. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism by targeting a Jewish collective in a potentially harmful manner.",Yes,"The tweet ""@thewritingMC Now what can the Jews do?"" is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). While it doesn't explicitly use classical antisemitic imagery or deny the Holocaust, the phrasing ""what can the Jews do"" implies a questioning tone that targets Jews collectively. This could infer negative intentions or collective responsibility, fitting into the category of indirect or coded antisemitism. The tweet's vagueness allows for an interpretation that reflects negatively on Jews as a group, aligning with guidelines that highlight the importance of not making sweeping generalizations about a population based on their identity. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic under the JDA definition."

While it may express strong opinions about how American Jews feel, it does not contain antisemitic content as defined by IHRA. Antisemitism involves targeting Jewish individuals or groups with harmful stereotypes or discrimination, which is not present here. The tweet focuses on the act of trivializing the Holocaust rather than expressing hate towards Jews. Therefore, based on IHRA's criteria, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. While it addresses Holocaust denial, which is explicitly antisemitic (see guideline 5), the tweet does not target Jews as a group or involve stereotypes or hostility toward them. Instead, it condemns an antisemitic act without directing antisemitic sentiment against Jewish people, thereby not constituting antisemitism itself."

This uses historical trauma to critique current institutions, aligning with IHRA's definition by making mendacious allegations against Jewish groups. The mention of being ""brainwashed again"" and blaming these entities fits the antisemitic framework, as it collectively accuses them of enabling harm against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet references the persecution of Jews during Nazi Germany and implies that similar actions are happening again. It uses language critical of MSM, politicians, and educators for allowing such occurrences, which can be interpreted as hostile towards Jews.

This chant uses derogatory language to equate Jews with animals, a tactic historically associated with antisemitic rhetoric. Additionally, the context of the protest being labeled as a human rights rally adds weight to the notion that Jew-hatred is present. TheIHRA definition of antisemitism includes such manifestations as targeting Jewish individuals and groups with hate speech, and this chant clearly fits within that framework.

This implies a Jewish entitlement to the region that delegitimizes Palestinian rights, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish superiority in claims to land. Thus, it fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish communities and their perceived rights.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics as defined by the JDA. It presents a speculative political scenario involving Jewish migration and Israeli policy changes, which falls under permissible criticism of a state's actions (as per guidelines).

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews for societal issues through such stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet includes a Hitler quote that attributes responsibility for bringing ""Negroes"" into Germany to Jews, aiming to ruin the white race through bastardization. This links Jews with harmful racial theories and actions historically associated with antisemitism, as per JDA guidelines.
