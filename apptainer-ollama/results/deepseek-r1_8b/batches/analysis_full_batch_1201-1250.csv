She was murdered immediately in a gas chamber. She is the oldest #Holocaust victim from the Netherlands - she was 102 years old. https://t.co/6LuwEntc6s,No,"The tweet provides factual information about Klara Borstel-Engelsman, a Jewish Holocaust survivor, detailing her persecution and death. It does not contain any rhetoric or actions that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, such as conspiracy theories, blaming Jews for wrongdoing, denying the Holocaust, or using stereotypes. Instead, it respectfully commemorates her experience.",No,"The tweet does not deny the Holocaust but instead provides a factual account of Klara Borstel-Engelsman's tragic death during the Holocaust. It neither spreads hate nor supports antisemitic views, aligning with JDA guidelines that focus on denying or minimizing the Holocaust rather than its documentation."

It highlights their difficulties without implying any negative stereotypes, blame, or conspiracy theories about Jews. There's no mention of Jews being responsible for the situation or holding them accountable in a way that aligns with antisemitic tropes. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not contain any antisemitic content. It discusses the challenges faced by Venezuelan Jews during Passover due to the lack of electricity, which is a factual and empathetic statement. There are no negative stereotypes, generalizations, or references to classical antisemitic tropes. Additionally, it does not deny the Holocaust nor promote hostility toward Jews. Therefore, the tweet is not in violation of the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This aligns with antisemitic notions of disloyalty toward a non-Jewish entity, fitting the IHRA criteria by targeting Jewish voters based on their loyalty accusations.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jewish individuals would be considered disloyal if they vote for the Democratic Party. This implies that being Jewish inherently ties one's political loyalty to a specific party (in this case, Trump's Republican party). Such a statement reinforces antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jewish identity with political disloyalty and stigmatizing Jews who do not support a particular cause. According to JDA guidelines, this type of coded language that associates Jews with disloyalty constitutes antisemitism as it perpetuates negative generalizations about the Jewish community. Therefore, the tweet is indeed antisemitic."

Establishment Jewish leaders were offended that @AOC applied the language of Never Again to Trump's barbarism. Young Jewish activists are invoking Never Again to fight it https://t.co/UQOxeMPqex,No,"The tweet discusses internal divisions among American Jews regarding political responses to Trump's actions, using ""Never Again"" as a metaphor. It does not involve antisemitic rhetoric such as conspiracy theories, negative stereotypes, or attacks on Jewish individuals or institutions. Instead, it reflects a political debate within the community and thus does not qualify as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet discusses a political debate among American Jews regarding the use of the term ""Never Again"" in a critical context. While ""Never Again"" is heavily associated with Holocaust remembrance, its use here refers to preventing harmful policies rather than promoting antisemitic stereotypes or targeting Jews as a group. The focus is on political disagreement and moral stance, not race-based hatred or conspiracy theories. Thus, it doesn't fit the criteria for antisemitism outlined in the JDA guidelines."

That he was a Jew is undeniable.,Yes,"The tweet references Jesus as undeniably a Jew. While this may seem factual, it is framed in a way that could perpetuate negative stereotypes or attack Jewish communities by asserting Jewishness in a confrontational manner. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly the use of stereotypical allegations and potentially demeaning language towards Jews. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitic speech as it targets Jewish identity in a context that can be harmful to Jewish individuals or communities.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism. It simply states a historical fact about Jesus being recognized as Jewish by Pilate. This affirmation of Jesus' Jewish identity is a neutral historical observation and does not involve discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. There is no evidence of classical antisemitic stereotypes, nor does it deny the Holocaust or imply harmful generalizations about Jews. The content is factual and does not target Jews for being Jewish in a negative way."

Twenty-five of them are Democrats; 2 are Republicans.\n\nThere is no Jexodus movement.,No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior. It provides factual information about Jewish representation in Congress and critiques Trump's statement without targeting Jews or using harmful stereotypes, thus adhering to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet claims that the Democratic Party is ""Anti-Jewish,"" using the fact that 25 out of 27 Jewish members in the U.S. House are Democrats. This statement implies a negative stereotype by suggesting a political party's anti-Semitism based on its Jewish membership, aligning with antisemitic tropes. It also references a non-existent Jexodus movement to stigmatize Jewish Democrats, which could contribute to the perception of collective blame and reinforce antisemitic ideas. Thus, this tweet adheres to patterns identified as antisemitic under the JDA guidelines, including making sweeping negative generalizations based on Jewish presence in a political context."
1132971289696595968,PradzWorLd,2019-05-27 11:26:19+00:00,0,Jews,NYC: hundreds of Jews protest against Ilhan Omar at Times Square https://t.co/sHIRnZPFBv,No,"The tweet describes a protest organized by Jewish individuals against Ilhan Omar, focusing on political opposition rather than any antisemitic content or actions directed at Jews. It does not involve blaming Jews for conspiracies, denying the Holocaust, stereotyping, or other antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet describes a protest led by Jewish individuals in NYC against Ilhan Omar, focusing on their opposition to her stance on Israel. This context does not involve antisemitic stereotypes, generalizations, or link Jews collectively to negative attributes. It's a report of a specific political action, which, under the JDA guidelines, does not qualify as antisemitic."

My family members are proud Jews, proud Americans, proud Democrats - and embarrassed by the Oaf in the Oval Office. \n https://t.co/YPSLWb676C",Yes,"The tweet references a perception of American Jews' loyalty, echoing antisemitic stereotypes that link Jewish identity to disloyalty. This aligns with IHRA's example of accusing Jews collectively of being less loyal to their country because of their Jewishness, making it an instance of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references an antisemitic trope where Jewish loyalty to the U.S. is questioned. It cites Trump's implication of disloyalty among American Jews, which aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish loyalty. The use of terms like ""serial adulterer"" and ""Oaf in the Oval Office"" adds a dismissive tone towards Trump but does not negate the underlying stereotype being invoked. Thus, it adheres to JDA guidelines as it uses coded language to imply Jews may lack loyalty, constituting antisemitic speech."

It mentions his support for violence against Jews by glorifying the murderer of the Tree of Life Synagogue. This targeting and glorification of violent acts against Jews align with antisemitic behavior, which involves hatred towards Jewish individuals or groups. Additionally, accusing him of being a conservative voice defended by media entities without addressing his antisemitic remarks reinforces the perception of tolerance for such harmful views, thus fitting within the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet expresses hatred towards Jews by describing Paul Nehlen as a white supremacist who hates Jews, promoting a race war. It includes antisemitic imagery (the Tree of Life Synagogue murderer's face) and aligns with classical antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies and secret power. This directly violates the JDA guidelines on discrimination against Jews for their identity, use of hateful rhetoric, and promotion of violence."

It targets them with the term ""scum"" and implies an attack on Jewish people at a pro-Palestine rally, suggesting antisemitic behavior by conflating Zionism with Judaism in a harmful manner. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves verbal abuse directed at Jewish individuals based on their perceived Jewishness.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language (""scum"") directed at individuals identified as Zionists, challenging their Jewish identity. This constitutes discrimination and hostility against Jews or those perceived as such, aligning with antisemitic tropes by attacking individuals based on their beliefs tied to Zionism.

Mo Brooks quotes Hitler's antisemitic accusations about Jews. By comparing Democrats to ""lying, conniving Jews,"" the tweet employs classical antisemitic stereotypes and aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it targets a group with harmful stereotypes and rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet references Adolf Hitler's antisemitic rhetoric from Mein Kampf, specifically his ""Big Lie"" accusation against Jews, and associates this with Democrats as a political party. This invokes classic antisemitic stereotypes and generalizes negatively about Democrats by linking them collectively to anti-Semitism. According to the JDA guidelines, such sweeping generalizations and the invocation of historical antisemitic ideology constitute discrimination against Jews as Jews, thereby qualifying the tweet as antisemitic. The tweet also aligns with guideline B7 by stigmatizing a group (Democrats) based on their association with Israel-related issues, contributing to the overall antisemitic tone."

This comparison aligns with IHRA's example of using Nazi-associated imagery or ideologies to characterize groups, making it antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet associates Trump supporters with domestic terrorism and targets Jews, Hispanics, and blacks for elimination. This grouping of Trump supporters as inherently dangerous and violent, particularly against Jewish people, falls under the JDA's definition of antisemitism by stereotyping a group based on negative actions without evidence of each individual's guilt. It also aligns with the idea that Jews are linked to evil or persecution, which is central to antisemitic ideology. Thus, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic."

Then SS stormtroopers were rounding up Jews for Hitler's concentration camps to be terminated. Were Nazi propagandists calling Jews rats also is a term of endearment? https://t.co/MDxGg2EQAK,Yes,"The tweet references Nazi propaganda that dehumanizes Jews by comparing them to rats and associates it with the atrocities committed by the SS against Jews. This use of demeaning stereotypes and historical context targeting Jewish people fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes negative depictions and associations that harm Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses language that compares Jews to vermin (rats) and references Nazi propaganda and the Holocaust. According to the JDA definition, such comparisons dehumanize Jews and are considered forms of antisemitism. The mention of Nazi imagery and historical atrocities reinforces harmful stereotypes and trivializes the suffering endured by Jews during the Holocaust. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic speech as defined by the JDA."

This chant targets Jewish people as a collective and implies exclusion or discrimination against them. By defending such rhetoric, the tweet aligns with antisemitic ideology that demeans or scapegoats Jewish individuals. Antisemitism often involves blaming Jews for societal issues or inciting fear against them, which is evident here. The use of such language constitutes hatred toward Jewish people as a group, fitting IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet links the president's defense of neo-Nazis chanting an antisemitic slogan to attacks on synagogues. According to the JDA, this constitutes hostility against Jewish institutions ( guideline 3), making it antisemitic."

This aligns with antisemitic rhetoric, which often dehumanizes or negatively targets Jewish individuals. The comment reduces Jewish people to a group unworthy of concern, fitting the IHRA definition by expressing prejudice against Jews as a collective, thereby qualifying it as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet equates caring about Jews with a personal benefit, reducing them to a dismissive stereotype. This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes and the JDA's guidelines on coded language and targeted discrimination against Jews."

While the humor about a shark eating a Gazan may not directly target Jews, the context implies a fascination with blaming Jews, aligning with antisemitic tropes of conspiracies and mendacious allegations against Jewish collectives. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes such expressions as targeting Jewish groups or suggesting conspiracies.",Yes,"The tweet employs humor to suggest that Arabs and Jihadis are considering blaming Jews for issues, using the example of a Gazan being eaten by a shark. While humorous, this implies a link between Jews and negative outcomes, aligning with antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence or responsibility in problematic situations. The mention of sharks, though absurd, serves to mock the idea of attributing blame to Jews, potentially hinting at broader conspiratorial ideas. Thus, it meets the criteria for indirect antisemitism as outlined by the JDA."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves harmful stereotypes, dehumanization, and comparisons to extremist ideologies.",Yes,"The tweet uses Nazi rhetoric to equate BDS rallies with antisemitic ideas, associating Jews with being the ""hated other"" and not fitting into Europe.

It emphasizes educational awareness rather than expressing hate or stereotypes. According to IHRA's definition, this does not fit antisemitic behavior as it lacks harmful content or intent.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior. It discusses the historical persecution of Mizrahi Jews during the Shoah, emphasizing the importance of recognizing this aspect of history. This is an educational statement about a specific group's suffering, not an expression of prejudice or hostility against Jewish people as a whole. The JDA guidelines specify that discussing historical events, even contentious ones, does not constitute antisemitism unless it involves harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories, which are absent here."

It critiques specific individuals' silence in response to public remarks without attributing collective blame or employing harmful stereotypes about Jewish people. While it may express disapproval of certain Jewish individuals, it doesn't align with the examples provided under the IHRA definition, such as Holocaust denial, conspiracy theories, or systematic blaming of all Jews for societal issues. The critique is focused on personal actions and political stances rather than broader antisemitic ideologies.",Yes,"The tweet crosses the line into antisemitism by implying that Modern Orthodox Jews, who are Jewish, should have a specific loyalty to Israel. This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish dual loyalty and disloyalty, as outlined in JDA guidelines B7 and B10. By calling them ""pretenders,"" it dismisses their authenticity as Jews, reinforcing negative stereotypes. The criticism goes beyond political disagreement and targets their Jewish identity, constituting discrimination against Jews as Jews."

People who stood up for equality &amp; justice were vilified and criminalized. \n\nLegality is not a guide for morality!,No,"The tweet does not specifically target Jewish individuals or groups. It broadly discusses the relationship between legality and morality by referencing historical events such as the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation. While these events are deeply associated with harm to specific groups, the tweet does not attribute blame to Jewish people collectively or use antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories. Instead, it reflects on the evolution of societal norms regarding morality and legality. Therefore, based on the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews or apply antisemitic stereotypes. It discusses legality vs. morality in a general sense using historical examples, without connecting Jews or Israel specifically. While some phrases might suggest negative implications about helping Jews, the overall message is about moral judgment exceeding legal frameworks and doesn't fit the criteria of antisemitism as defined by JDA."

The statement appears to be a political critique rather than an antisemitic attack.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Donald Trump is attacking both Jewish people and the left simultaneously. This grouping of Jews with another group (the left) can reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish influence or conspiracy, which aligns with antisemitic tropes as defined by the JDA. Even if not explicitly stating antisemitic beliefs, associating Jews collectively with another group in a critical context can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and thus qualifies as antisemitic according to the guidelines."

This comparison dehumanizes Jewish people and aligns with the IHRA definition by employing negative depictions that reflect prejudice against the Jewish community.",Yes,"The tweet contains a reference where Glyn Secker is reported to have compared Jews to rats in the gutter, which is a dehumanizing and stereotypical depiction of Jewish people. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines, specifically point 3, as it uses language that degrades Jews by associating them with vermin, thereby promoting antisemitic imagery.
