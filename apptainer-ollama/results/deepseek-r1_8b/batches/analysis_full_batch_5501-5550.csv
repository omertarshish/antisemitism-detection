Additionally, mentioning a T-shirt celebrating ""the Tree"" could reference antisemitic symbols or attacks on Jewish institutions. This rhetoric seeks to harm Jews and fits the criteria for antisemitism as per IHRA guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet mentions Paul Nehlen wanting to remove Jews from the U.S., which is a form of discrimination against Jewish people. Additionally, the reference to ""wearing a T-shirt celebrating the Tree"" could be linked to antisemitic symbols, making the statement hostile towards Jews. This aligns with JDA's definition of antisemitism as it involves prejudice and hostility towards Jews based on their identity."

But reality is all Americans 4 Trump. ??,No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA. While the initial statement ""Jews 4 Trump"" could be interpreted as stereotyping Jewish support for Trump, the subsequent clarification that ""all Americans 4 Trump"" adds context that negates the targeting of Jews. The inclusion of the question mark also suggests uncertainty rather than a definitive antisemitic assertion. Therefore, considering the overall content and context, the tweet is not classified as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as it does not target Jews negatively or employ stereotypes. It supports Trump and notes that many Americans support him, without any specific mention of Jewish identity beyond promoting Jewish support for Trump, which is a positive expression and not discriminatory."

This inclusion of Jews as a specific group could reinforce negative stereotypes associating conservatism with Jewish identity, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jews as a collective in a potentially harmful context.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic under the JDA definition because it does not involve discrimination against Jews as Jews but instead categorizes conservative individuals from various backgrounds, which is a neutral inquiry without any negative implications or stereotypes directed at Jewish people."

While not explicitly antisemitic, the implication that her loyalty is to protect Jews over her national interests aligns with IHRA's example of accusing Jewish citizens of having a higher loyalty to Israel or Jewish causes than their own nation. This touches on stereotypes about collective Jewish responsibility and loyalty, thus fitting within the definition of antisemitism as it denigrates or demeans Jews as a group.",No,"The tweet criticizes Susan Collins' actions and suggests her cowardice in dealing with Trump is not related to protecting Jews. This critique is a political statement regarding her behavior, not directed at Jews or Jewish issues. It does not use antisemitic imagery, symbols, or stereotypes. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Thank you, next.",Yes,"The tweet uses a statistic about Jewish voters supporting the Democratic party in a way that can be interpreted as dismissive or sarcastic. While not explicitly hateful, it implies a negative view of non-Jewish individuals and could reinforce stereotypes about Jewish loyalty to political causes over others, aligning with IHRA's examples of antisemitic rhetoric.",No,"The tweet mentions that 75% of Jews voted Democratic and thanks followers. While it uses a statistic about Jewish political preferences, it doesn't exhibit discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. It doesn't apply classical antisemitic stereotypes or imply conspiracy theories. Instead, it's a factual observation, even if potentially stereotyping, which doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA guidelines."

It suggests that Jewish people are involved in specific activities (in this case, referring to the Al Jazeera 'Lobby' documentary) in a way that could be interpreted as conspiratorial or discriminatory. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes making dehumanizing or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective. The use of ""your people"" with a parenthetical clarification to ""(i.e., Jews)"" reinforces the targeting of Jewish individuals in a potentially harmful manner, fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet refers to a scenario where a Labour member mentions a document from Al Jazeera titled ""Lobby"" and then states, ""one of your people (i.e., Jews) on l�."" This statement implies that Jews are being discussed in a context that suggests they have undue influence or control. According to the JDA guidelines, this aligns with antisemitic tropes such as the conspiracy theory where Jews are depicted as having hidden power or influence over institutions and governments. The mention of Jews in this manner reflects the classical antisemitic stereotype of Jewish conspiracies and can be seen as an indirect or coded form of antisemitism. Therefore, based on the evidence presented in the tweet and the application of JDA guidelines, it is determined that the statement constitutes antisemitic behavior."

By implying that Jack Posobiec is already hated for these reasons and questioning if there are worse aspects, the tweet promotes a negative perception of Jews as a collective. This rhetoric falls under mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews, fitting the criteria outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet ""@JackPosobiec You mean besides hating Jews and Israel?"" directly targets Jack Posobiec by implying that he is hated because of his Jewish identity. This statement discriminates against him as a Jew, in line with antisemitic definitions which consider discrimination or prejudice against individuals based on their ethnicity. The tweet associates hatred towards Posobiec solely due to his Jewish background, aligning with the JDA's classification of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews for being Jewish."

This statement is antisemitic as it uses historical events to suggest collaboration between non-Jewish groups and the Nazis in persecuting Jews, reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jewish victimization and implying collective guilt or responsibility. It aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism through its reliance on historical allegations that can perpetuate antisemitic narratives.",Yes,"The tweet references historical events where the Muslim Brotherhood fought alongside the Nazis against Jews during WWII. This statement can be interpreted as promoting or referencing antisemitic ideology by implying collaboration between different groups targeting Jews. According to the JDA, this type of historical reference can reinforce negative stereotypes and diminish the severity of the Holocaust, thereby aligning with antisemitic rhetoric. Additionally, it generalizes negatively about Jewish persecution, which falls under the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines."

It critiques specific Jewish individuals for certain behaviors without attacking all Jews or using dehumanizing language. The criticism is focused on their actions and beliefs, not on a broader negative perception of the Jewish community.",Yes,"The tweet associates Jewish individuals like Glenn Greenwald, Miko Peled, and Norman Finkelstein together based on their ethnicity, suggesting a negative grouping. This reduces their individual perspectives to their Jewish identity, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism through stereotyping and collective implication."

Progressive wolves in sheeps clothing� https://t.co/sbCspaF2mJ,Yes,"The tweet targets American Jews directly and uses a phrase that can be interpreted as implying deceptive behavior by progressive individuals, which could reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish people. While not explicitly hateful, the content directs attention toward Jewish individuals in a context that aligns with antisemitic tropes, making it fitting for an antisemitic classification under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet warns American Jews to learn from Britain's mistakes and uses the phrase ""Progressive wolves in sheeps clothing,"" suggesting a negative characterization of Jewish identity. While not explicitly antisemitic in classic terms, it singles out Jews for criticism and implies they are part of a problematic group, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes that target Jews collectively based on their Jewishness. This approach discriminates against Jews as Jews, falling under the JDA's definition of antisemitism by making sweeping negative generalizations and invoking stereotypes linked to evil forces."

This phrasing targets a Jewish individual (Stephen Miller) with an assertion that could imply collective blame or reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews, aligning with antisemitic rhetoric as defined by IHRA. While it may be a political statement, its language carries implications that fit within the framework of antisemitism by associating harm to Jews with a Jewish individual.",Yes,"The tweet associates Stephen Miller's Jewish background with being ""bad for the Jews,"" which stereotypically links Jewish identity with negative outcomes. This aligns with JDA guidelines that consider making sweeping generalizations or implying inherent traits based on ethnicity as antisemitic, thus targeting Jews as Jews."

Instead, it compares two historical events involving different groups and states, focusing on broader political points rather than directly implicating Jewish people or using antisemitic language.",Yes,"The tweet draws an inappropriate comparison between the Holocaust and another event involving ethnic cleansing. It refers to Arab states ethnically cleansing 99%, which, assuming it targets Jews, links the suffering of Jews to another group's actions. This not only conflates two distinct events but also can be seen as delegating blame onto others for violence against Jews. The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination against Jews, and this tweet's use of sweeping generalizations and historical comparisons harmfully associates Jews with such violence, thus adhering to antisemitic tropes."

It discusses the necessity of mentioning Jews in Holocaust-related tweets, which emphasizes their role in history rather than targeting or dehumanizing them. There is no use of harmful stereotypes, denial of Holocaust facts, or collective blame of Jews. The content focuses on inclusion and proper reference, not on attacking Jewish individuals or communities. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not reflect antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It discusses the importance of acknowledging Jewish suffering during the Holocaust, which is a factual and historical point, not an expression of prejudice or hostility against Jews. There is no evidence of denying or minimizing the Holocaust, nor is there any discriminatory language targeting Jews. The retweet emphasizes the historical context rather than promoting antisemitic views."

Some love you are spewing https://t.co/cp57E4eGg9,Yes,"The tweet expresses a desire for the destruction of both Israel and the Jewish people, which directly aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Antisemitism includes hatred towards Jews and can manifest in calls for their harm. Here, the destruction of Israel and Jews is advocated, constituting a clear manifestation of antisemitic hate.",Yes,"The tweet expresses a desire for the destruction of both Israel and the Jewish people. According to the JDA, antisemitism includes hostility or discrimination against Jews as Jews (Point 3). The mention of destroying both Israel (a Jewish state) and Jews directly targets them based on their ethnicity, fitting the definition of antisemitism. Points 7 and 10 in section B reinforce that holding Jews responsible for Israel's actions and denying their right to exist collectively are antisemitic. Thus, the tweet violates these guidelines by advocating harm against Jewish people and their state."

According to the IHRA definition, this could be seen as antisemitic because it implies criticism towards Jewish people based on their identity and collective actions, aligning with examples of blaming Jewish individuals or groups for wrongdoing.",No,"After analyzing the tweet in light of the JDA guidelines, it does not exhibit antisemitic behavior. The content criticizes a Congresswoman's perceived double standard regarding her statements about Jews but does not target Jews as a group or involve negative stereotypes or conspiracies.

According to the IHRA definition, this involves rhetorical manifestations directed at Jewish individuals, fitting the criteria for antisemitism by accusing a person of targeting Jews collectively.",Yes,"The tweet references Al Sharpton's alleged incitement of violence against Jews in Crown Heights. This involves attacks on Jewish individuals, which falls under the category of antisemitism as defined by the JDA, specifically through hostile actions against Jews as a group."

It suggests that British Jews only represent a specific type and not others, reinforcing stereotypes of Jewish conspiracies or control. This reductionist view can marginalize and typecast Jewish individuals, fitting the IHRA definition's criteria for antisemitism by targeting Jewish groups with negative stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet in question targets ""British Jews"" by implying that they only represent a specific type of Jewish individual and not others. This generalization can be seen as a form of discrimination against the Jewish population, aligning with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA. The use of terms like ""your ilk"" suggests a negative stereotype or sweeping judgment about all Jews, falling under indirect antisemitism as defined by the guidelines. Therefore, this tweet violates the JDA's antisemitism criteria."

This aligns with IHRA's definition by drawing a link to past antisemitic actions and potentially promoting harmful stereotypes, thus constituting antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question does not constitute antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition provided. The tweet references Kristallnacht, a historical event, and poses a hypothetical question about someone making an analogy regarding it. While antisemitism can involve historical or contemporary references, this particular tweet does not contain any content that demonstrates discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. There is no indication of stereotyping, coded language, or a link to broader antisemitic beliefs about Jewish conspiracy or inherent negative traits. The tweet appears to be a neutral reference to historical context and does not advocate for harm or stigmatization of Jews.

This alignment with antisemitic rhetoric, specifically blaming Jewish conspiracies for societal issues, fits within the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet equates anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim conspiracy theories as interconnected, referencing the Pittsburgh massacre and the Christchurch attack. It links these events to a broader conspiracy theory that Jews and Muslims supposedly control society through secret means. By associating both massacres with such ideologies, it promotes harmful stereotypes about Jewish and Muslim influence, which aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA guidelines. The tweet's explicit mention of conspiracies against both groups without directly targeting them as individuals still falls under antisemitic speech, as it spreads negative generalizations and dangerous beliefs that can incite violence."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes demonizing or negatively stereotyping Jewish individuals or groups.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews are being discredited, which aligns with antisemitic hostility by targeting Jews collectively based on their religion. This fits the JDA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves prejudice and hostility towards Jews, even if not explicitly stated in a traditional form."

By blaming the Women's March for hating Jews, the tweet perpetuates a conspiracy theory linking Jewish communities to negativity.

This directly invokes a well-documented antisemitic atrocity, thereby aligning with the JDA's guidelines that identify such actions as antisemitic. Specifically, guideline 5 mandates that minimizing or denying the Holocaust is antisemitic, and this tweet does so by focusing on a severe historical incident without appropriate context or recognition of its severity. Thus, it falls under antisemitic behavior as defined."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves blaming Jews for harm caused by others and using historical context to reinforce antisemitic stereotypes. The mention of the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928, connects to a narrative that suggests collaboration against Jews, fitting into the broader framework of scapegoating Jews for societal issues or atrocities. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it targets Jews and uses historical references to promote harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet connects the Nazi regime with the Muslim Brotherhood, suggesting an alliance targeting Jews. According to JDA guidelines, this implies a linkage between these groups and antisemitic beliefs, reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews. It aligns with guideline A(2), which highlights the idea of Jews being linked to evil forces, used by various causes. Thus, the tweet discriminates against Jews as Jews, fitting the definition of antisemitism."

Additionally, the mention of ""condemns Jews"" without context could imply negative stereotypes about Jewish people. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, where such language can reinforce harmful perceptions of Jews as a threat or conspiring group. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet uses language associated with messianic imagery, which links Jews to opposition towards Trump. After assuming these roles, Trump condemns Jews as a group. This associates Jews collectively with negative sentiments, fulfilling the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This statement does not blame Jews for the existence of antisemitism but instead seeks to absolve them.

Therefore, based on the provided information, this tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet in question states, ""Black people don't cause racism. Muslims don't cause Islamophobia. Jews don't cause anti-Semitism."" This statement aligns with antisemitic tropes as it implies that Jewish people are not responsible for antisemitism, thus reinforcing the perception that they are passive victims rather than agents of change. According to the JDA guidelines, particularly guideline 2 and 4, this can be seen as minimizing Jewish agency and essentializing negative stereotypes about Jewish people, which is a form of indirect antisemitism. By asserting that Jews do not cause anti-Semitism, the tweet may inadvertently downplay or justify antisemitic views, thus perpetuating harmful biases against the Jewish community.

This targets non-Jewish individuals (Omar) based on their association with Israel-related issues, potentially reflecting antisemitic sentiment by grouping Jews together against someone who holds controversial views towards Israel. It aligns with IHRA's definition as it involves directing actions against Jewish collectivities, possibly using negative stereotypes or prejudice against Omar's stance on Israel.",Yes,"The tweet calls upon all Jews to collectively act against Ilhan Omar, a Jewish member of Congress, based on her political stance related to Israel. This aligns with JDA guidelines that consider it antisemitic to hold Jews responsible for the actions of others or to take collective action against them because of their identity and association with Israel-related issues. Specifically, it reflects guideline 7, which discusses treating Jews as agents of Israel's conduct, and guideline 8, which involves requiring Jewish individuals to condemn Israeli policies. The tweet's demand targets Omar specifically for her views, making it an example of indirect or coded antisemitism where Jews are collectively blamed for certain actions.

This statement might be used to suggest that Jews have undue influence or advantage, thus playing into antisemitic tropes about Jewish capabilities affecting others unfairly.

This statement implies a negative perspective on Jewish self-defense, reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish vulnerability or the need for protection. It aligns with historical antisemitic tropes that view Jews as requiring assistance rather than being capable of self-defense. According to the JDA guidelines, this reflects discrimination against Jews as Jews, falling under the definition of antisemitism. The use of ""them"" (referring to Jews) to express upset about their newfound ability to defend themselves contributes to a negative portrayal that fits within the parameters of antisemitic discourse."

This comparison draws an explicit link between historical antisemitic behavior and the treatment of Jews, reinforcing classical antisemitic themes of persecution and dehumanization. By invoking the Holocaust to make this comparison, the tweet evokes the history of Jews being subjected to demeaning or forced actions, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. This alignment occurs because the tweet uses the historical context of the Holocaust to suggest that Jews are again being coerced into performing tasks, thereby linking them to a narrative of persecution and subjugation.

This action constitutes a direct attack on Jewish property and heritage. According to the JDA guidelines, such acts are considered antisemitic as they involve hostility or violence against Jewish institutions or property. Specifically, point 3 defines antisemitic deeds, including attacks on synagogues and Jewish graves, which align with this behavior.
