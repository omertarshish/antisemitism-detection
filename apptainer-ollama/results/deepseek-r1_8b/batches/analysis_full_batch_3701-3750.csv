This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, which include stereotyping and blaming Jewish collectives for societal issues through false narratives. The direct mention of ""Jews"" targets them based on a conspiracy theory, falling under antisemitic discourse that falsely accuses Jews of hidden motives or control.",Yes,"The tweet targets Jewish people by associating them with an absurd claim about space lasers being used only for hair removal. This generalizes Jews in a negative way, using stereotype and humor to belittle the group, aligning with antisemitic principles of targeting Jews as a collective with negative traits."

It references historical events to imply blame on Jewish or Zionist groups, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes negative stereotypes and blaming specific groups for situations. This use of stereotypes and collective blame fits the criteria outlined in the IHRA examples, indicating antisemitic undertones.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition. It uses historical comparisons to imply a connection between Zionist Jews and negative actions, aligning with classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies. By linking Jews collectively to such behavior, it violates guidelines B(7) and (10), which consider holding Jews responsible for others' conduct or denying their existence as antisemitic. The use of historical context to frame this argument further codes criticism against Jews, falling under the JDA's prohibitions against stigmatizing or collectively blaming Jewish groups."

This falsely impugns the integrity of Jewish or pro-Palestinian groups, suggesting they spread antisemitic ideas about selective vaccination targeting Jews. While not overtly antisemitic itself, it reinforces harmful stereotypes and false allegations against Jewish collectives, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through mendacious accusations and stereotyping.",No,"The tweet does not contain any language or implications that would be considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition. It addresses a claim by the BDS movement, which is a political stance, and refutes it by stating that Israel provides vaccines to all, regardless of ethnicity. While the tweet corrects misinformation and criticizes the BDS movement's claims, it does not invoke any racialized stereotypes or discrimination against Jews as Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined."

Additionally, it mentions Ivanka Trump's family as religious Jews, which could be seen as promoting stereotypes or implying collective blame against Jewish individuals.

While it uses the term ""Jews,"" it does so in a humorous, non-pejorative context without invoking any negative stereotypes or hostility towards Jewish people.

Because there isn’t anything identifying those men as Jews. Also, maybe black celebrities have tweeted that exact same image - with no complaints.",Yes,"The tweet contains elements of antisemitism as per the IHRA definition. It associates rich white individuals with Jews in a manner that could reinforce negative stereotypes, suggesting Jewish control over powerful institutions. Additionally, it implies a double standard where similar statements by other groups are not criticized, potentially normalizing antisemitic ideas about Jewish influence and control. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism involving stereotyping and unfair accusations against Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that all rich white individuals who ""rule the world"" are Jews, invoking a classic antisemitic stereotype of Jewish conspiracy and control over global affairs ( guideline A2 ). While it does not explicitly mention Jews, the implication aligns with harmful generalizations about Jewish power. The statement could be interpreted as targeting Jews by linking their identity to wealth and influence, even if not directly stated.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves rhetoric that can incite hatred towards Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""the jews"" to imply that Jewish people are playing Sonic, which could be interpreted as a negative stereotype or generalization about Jews.

This directly invokes historical antisemitic actions and language that targeted Jews, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism. The reference to concentration camps, a site of Jewish suffering, aligns with the examples provided, as it involves hateful rhetoric towards Jews and calls for their persecution.",Yes,"The tweet in question directly references the Holocaust by mentioning concentration camps and quotes Hitler. According to guideline 5 of the JDA, denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered antisemitic. Additionally, the quote's implication that Jews are being targeted because of their internal matters and external forces should not interfere reflects classical antisemitic tropes outlined in guidelines 2 and 7. This aligns with the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews for being Jewish, making the tweet clearly antisemitic."
