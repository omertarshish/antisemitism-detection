Truly disgraceful. She should resign or be expelled. Unfathomable.",Yes,"The tweet contains statements that invoke antisemitic stereotypes by falsely attributing wildfires to Jews controlling space, which fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism through its use of mendacious allegations and conspiracy theories targeting Jews.",Yes,"The tweet refers to a conspiracy theory implying Jewish control over natural disasters, which is a classic antisemitic stereotype. This aligns with JDA guidelines, especially point 2, linking Jews to harmful forces and using coded language to stigmatize. The user's condemnation of the Congress member for such statements reflects potential antisemitic bias, as per the defined criteria."

As long as it is against their favorite targets.\n\nImagine if someone were trending “Islam is poison” or “Jews are poison.” They'd see it as bigotry. \n\nBut some bigotry is platformed. Pure hate from Twitter.  @jack https://t.co/U0KieQotZI,Yes,"The tweet compares Twitter's handling of hate speech against different groups, specifically referencing ""Jews are poison."" This statement targets Jewish individuals and suggests that hate speech against them is permitted on the platform. According to IHRA, this kind of rhetoric accuses Jews of being responsible for negative actions or situations, which fits the definition of antisemitism as it can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and hatred towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet utilizes the analogy of ""Jews are poison"" to illustrate Twitter's apparent tolerance of hate speech directed at certain groups. This phrase directly targets Jews with a negative stereotype, falling under antisemitic language as defined by the JDA. By comparing this to other forms of hate speech, the tweet reinforces harmful biases and aligns with classical antisemitic tropes, making it clear that such content is antisemitic."

It implies that Jews aren't affected by certain cultural or religious references, thereby dehumanizing their identity. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes reducing Jewish people to stereotypes and using comparisons that harm Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet makes a generalization about Jewish people by implying they are not as preoccupied with religious figures like Satan compared to Christians. This reduction of Jewish identity to a cultural quirk rather than a religious one can contribute to negative stereotypes and is therefore aligned with the principles outlined in the JDA guidelines, specifically those related to making sweeping generalizations and stereotyping."

The basis of their hate makes the ultimate requisite of that, literal transmutation, infeasible.",Yes,"The tweet references Adolf Hitler's actions toward Jews during the Holocaust, drawing a comparison to white supremacists' treatment of Black people. While not explicitly targeting Jews, the mention of Hitler's persecution of Jews could be interpreted as invoking antisemitic historical context. This aligns with the IHRA definition, which considers statements that deny or minimize the Holocaust as antisemitic, even if not directly targeting Jews in this instance. The comparison could imply an underlying antisemitic perspective by linking different groups through their persecution, thus falling under the scope of antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It discusses historical figures and their failed attempts at racial transmutation without targeting Jews or using antisemitic stereotypes, imagery, or Holocaust denial. The focus is on a general statement about hate rather than any specific prejudice against Jews."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using mendacious allegations about Jews as a collective. Therefore, the tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references a ""Jew cabal,"" which invokes antisemitic stereotypes of Jewish conspiracy and secret control, as outlined in the JDA guidelines. This targets Jews based on their identity, fitting the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews. The warning of impending trouble from such attacks further underscores the prejudice involved, making the tweet inherently antisemitic."

It acknowledges different groups' roles in threatening Jews without implying any inherent Jewish responsibility or linking Jews to evil.

It does not promote hatred or make false accusations against a Jewish collective. Instead, it seeks to understand and combat such biases, aligning more with educational efforts than antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet discusses the prevalence of subtle anti-Semitic tendencies among well-meaning individuals, referencing problematic attitudes towards Jews. While it doesn't explicitly promote antisemitism, it examines how such stereotypes persist, which aligns with the JDA's concern about coded speech and general negative generalizations about Jewish people. This could contribute to the spread of harmful stereotypes by highlighting underlying biases, even if unintentional."

According to IHRA's definition, this targets Jewish individuals as victims, fitting antisemitic manifestations of violence directed at Jewish or perceived Jewish individuals, thus expressing hate towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Palestinian TikTok users are committing unprovoked assaults on Jewish individuals and implies that media is ignoring this. This framing targets Jewish people based on their identity, aligning with antisemitic narratives by linking a specific group (Palestinians) to violence against Jews. Such associations can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to antisemitic rhetoric, making the tweet violate the JDA definition of antisemitism."

It accurately mentions historical atrocities without targeting Jews beyond referencing their suffering during the Holocaust. The use of ""H----"" appears to refer to Hitler, and the mention of other victims reflects an inclusive recognition of historical crimes, not stereotyping or blaming Jews.

While the data is factually accurate, its presentation could reinforce antisemitic stereotypes by suggesting a disproportional targeting of Jews. According to the IHRA definition, this kind of information, when used to imply or perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jews as a group, can be considered antisemitic. The tweet does not explicitly express hatred but could inadvertently contribute to such perceptions, aligning with behaviors and attitudes listed in the IHRA examples. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet in question presents FBI data comparing the likelihood of hate crime victimization among Jews, blacks, and Muslims. While the data may be factually accurate, its phrasing could imply that Jews are more likely targets due to their identity. This reinforces stereotypes that Jews are collectively vulnerable, which aligns with elements of antisemitism by suggesting a linkage between Jewish identity and victimization. Such presentation risks contributing to discriminatory narratives, even if unintentional, as it touches on the broader context of stereotyping and potential targeting based on identity.

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, as it involves hateful rhetoric against a specific group, promoting negative perceptions that contribute to their exclusion or threat perception.",Yes,"The tweet references a well-known antisemitic chant from the Charlottesville rally, which explicitly targets Jews. According to JDA guidelines, this falls under category 3 as an example of antisemitic words, as it uses derogatory language against Jewish people based on their ethnicity.

Additionally, it refers to sharing antisemitic propaganda about Israel, which aligns with the definition's examples of stereotyping and conspiracy theories.

This includes targeting individuals based on their origin, which falls under criminal acts as defined by IHRA, aiming to harm Jewish or associated individuals. Additionally, the use of terms like ""lunatics"" and the implication that certain groups are responsible for negative outcomes align with antisemitic tropes of blaming specific groups for issues. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it involves hateful rhetoric targeting Jewish individuals and incitement to violence.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that some Jews should face danger in places like Gaza or Palestinian villages, implying a hostile stance against Jewish individuals.

It singles out Jewish individuals, warns of an influx of antisemitism linked to immigration from certain Islamic nations, and uses stereotypes that conflate antisemitism with these groups. This reinforces harmful perceptions that Jews are collectively responsible for or associated with antisemitism due to their immigration background, aligning withIHRA's examples of blaming Jewish collectives for societal issues and reinforcing dangerous stereotypes about Jewish identity and responsibility.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition.
