According to IHRA's definition, this constitutes antisemitism as it accuses Jewish people of responsibility for a significant societal issue, aligning with examples of blaming Jews for real or imagined wrongdoing. Such accusations employ stereotypes and negative character traits associated with antisemitic ideology. Therefore, this tweet is antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet describes an article in a Polish-language newspaper in Toronto that blames Jews for the COVID-19 pandemic. This aligns with JDA guidelines, specifically Point 2, which mentions antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies and hidden power. Blaming Jews for a global health crisis like a pandemic fits into the broader category of antisemitism, as it reflects a conspiracy theory that links a specific group to negative events. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism based on the JDA definition."

It targets Jewish individuals by suggesting they collectively dislike Rich McCormick, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes that dehumanize or negatively attribute characteristics to Jewish people. This form of questioning can perpetuate harmful biases and reinforce negative perceptions, fitting the definition of antisemitism as it involves blaming a group for dislikes or issues without valid context.",Yes,"The tweet raises a question about Jews not liking Rich McCormick, which could imply antisemitic undertones if it suggests Jewish people are collectively unfavorable towards him due to stereotypes or conspiracies. Without specific context, the phrasing aligns with potential coded antisemitism by linking Jewish identity to dislike, potentially invoking harmful stereotypes associated with antisemitic narratives."

While not explicitly targeting Jews, the language and context imply a critique of Jewish actions and influence, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish collectivism and power. This criticism reflects a form of indirect antisemitism as it uses Zionism to denigrate the presence and impact of Jews in Israel, thereby violating the JDA guidelines that prohibit holding Jews collectively responsible for political actions or denying their rights."

It critiques anti-Semitic propaganda and its impact on Jewish individuals in the UK but does not express hatred towards Jews or utilize negative stereotypes, thereby avoiding the criteria outlined for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""Anti-Semitic propaganda"" which refers to a form of speech that demeans or makes negative generalizations about Jews as a group. It expresses concern about the impact of such propaganda on Jews in the UK, potentially contributing to negative stereotypes and stigmatization of Jewish people. According to the JDA guidelines, this type of language can be considered antisemitic as it implies harmful generalizations about a specific population (Jews) based on their identity. The frustration expressed (""FFS"") further indicates hostility towards the issue, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism involving hostility or discrimination against Jews. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria outlined by the JDA for antisemitic speech."

It uses language suggesting Jews are being targeted by this theory, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by blaming a group for harm done through such theories.",Yes,"The tweet references an antisemitic conspiracy theory that implies Jews are being targeted and killed due to such beliefs. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes hostility towards Jews for reasons related to their identity. The mention of a conspiracy theory causing harm to Jews directly relates to guideline 5, as it denigrates Jews by associating them with harmful actions against others. Additionally, the theory reflects the broader antisemitic trope of Jewish influence over global events, falling under the scope of guideline 2 regarding the linkage of Jews to evil forces. Thus, the tweet's content meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

This comparison trivializes the Holocaust and creates a hostile environment for Jewish communities, making it antisemitic according to IHRA standards.",Yes,"The tweet compares the current situation in the USA to Nazi Germany, referencing the Holocaust. While not explicitly mentioning Jews, this comparison can be seen as trivializing historical Jewish suffering and potentially reflecting antisemitic ideas by associating contemporary issues with the atrocities of the Holocaust.

It reflects a neutral discussion about group identity, not antisemitism.",No,"The tweet discusses model minority groups (MMG) and expresses a neutral, non-discriminatory view about whether Jews and Asians can exist as such. It acknowledges the MM descriptor as a compliment without any negative or stereotypical implications towards Jews. There's no evidence of classical antisemitic content, nor does it link Jews to evil forces or use harmful stereotypes. The discussion is focused on societal concepts without targeting Jews negatively, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

This targets Jews by questioning their Jewishness based on religious beliefs, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes and denying Jewish self-determination, thus fitting IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews who believe in Jesus as the Messiah are no longer considered Jewish and refers to Jesus as a descendant rather than a religion. This implies a negative generalization about Jewish identity, potentially reinforcing stereotypes by stigmatizing those who do not conform to a specific religious belief. While it doesn't directly link Jews to evil or deny the Holocaust, it reduces Jewishness to a singular belief, aligning with antisemitic undertones that marginalize individuals based on their faith choices."

The statement is neutral and factual, focusing on a specific group's support without targeting Jews negatively.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics under the JDA definition. It accurately reports that some Iranian Jews supported Khomeini and participated in the Islamic Revolution, which is a factual statement rather than an attack or generalization against Jewish people. The use of ""many"" indicates it refers to a subset of individuals without suggesting a negative stereotype or conspiracy. Thus, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines."

This specific example from the IHRA definition mentions such stereotypes as indicative of antisemitism. While other points in the tweet do not directly target Jews, the inclusion of this particular reference is sufficient to classify the entire tweet as antisemitic. Antisemitism often uses such language to demean or stereotype Jewish people, and the mention here contributes to that negative perception.",Yes,"The tweet contains references that align with antisemitic stereotypes, such as ""Jews will not replace us,"" which invokes classic antisemitic notions of Jewish conspiracy and replacement theories. Additionally, the mention of an imaginary wall paid by Mexico can be seen as a coded reference to broader antisemitic conspiracies about Jewish control over finances or political structures. While other parts of the tweet do not directly target Jews, the inclusion of these specific phrases and their association with antisemitic stereotypes make the tweet antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

While the user strongly criticizes this portrayal, the content does not align with antisemitic criteria outlined by the JDA.

It implies that these people target Jewish individuals and other groups collectively based on their identity. This aligns with antisemitic rhetoric by associating Jewish identity with hatred towards others and grouping multiple groups together in a context of collective blame or targeting.

This statement invokes a comparison between Jewish identity and the concept of indigeneity, which can be problematic. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism often involves targeting Jewish communities or relating Jewish identity to controversial or divisive issues. By equating Jews with indigenous groups in this context, the tweet could imply a connection that is potentially harmful and aligns with negative stereotypes or narratives about Jews. This approach risks marginalizing Jewish communities by conflating their identity with sensitive territorial disputes, thereby contributing to an environment that discriminates against Jews.
