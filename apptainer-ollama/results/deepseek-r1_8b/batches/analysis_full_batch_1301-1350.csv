It references religious texts without making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews, nor does it involve blaming Jews for conspiracies, denying the Holocaust, or promoting violence. The focus is on differing perspectives within Judaism, not targeting Jews as a collective in an antisemitic manner.",No,"The tweet discusses Jewish religious beliefs regarding Passover, specifically referencing a passage from Psalm 16. It explains that for some Jews, this day holds significance due to their faith in Yeshua's resurrection as traced back to the Hebrew Bible. The content does not involve any discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. There is no indication of essentializing or making negative generalizations about Jews.

According to the IHRA definition, this constitutes antisemitism as it is a rhetorical manifestation directed at Jewish people. While other parts of the tweet discuss political views unrelated to antisemitism, the mention of hating Jews suffices to classify the tweet as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly states that J_oshHill ""hates Jews,"" which is a direct manifestation of antisemitism as defined by the JDA. This statement aligns with guideline 3, which identifies hostility towards Jews as a form of antisemitism. While the rest of the tweet discusses policy preferences, the initial comment about hating Jews serves as a clear example of antisemitic content. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic based on this criterion."

[Qur'an 9:30]",Yes,"The tweet targets Jewish individuals by falsely attributing statements to them and criticizes these statements harshly. It uses religious figures central to Jewish identity to imply that Jews are deluded and deserving of destruction, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves collective blame and incitement against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet in question exhibits elements of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It generalizes negatively about Jews and Christians, using derogatory language such as ""May Allah destroy them"" and labels their religious beliefs as delusions.

The tweet does not fall under protected forms of criticism or political speech, making it tantamount to antisemitic discourse."

It does not express hatred towards or blame Jewish people for wrongdoing but critiques the behavior of those exhibiting antisemitism. While it refers to Talmudic Jews, there's no intent to demean them or incite hatred. Thus, according to IHRA's definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references ""Talmudic Jews,"" which can perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jewish identity. This term suggests a judgment that such Jews are either good or bad, contributing to the reinforcement of harmful generalizations. Additionally, the use of ""antisemites"" in a way that lumps together conflicting views about Jewish groups reflects the application of antisemitic tropes and can be seen as an effort to dehumanize or stereotype Jewish communities. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines regarding the avoidance of such sweeping generalizations and the perpetuation of antisemitic notions."

This implies a potential association that could reinforce antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish influence in politics. While not explicitly hateful, it frames the link negatively, potentially suggesting undue Jewish political influence, which aligns with harmful antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies and control over societal institutions. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA, as it involves a negative stereotype and an unfair blame of Jewish collectivity in political contexts.",Yes,"The tweet ""Donald Trump: The Odd Link between American Jews and the Alt-Right"" is deemed antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines. By implying a connection between American Jews and the alt-right, it suggests an inherent link that could be interpreted as a negative stereotype or coded antisemitism. This association might reflect prejudice against Jews collectively being part of a controversial movement, falling under the category of indirect or coded speech that links Jewish identity with negative groups, thus violating the principles of equality and non-discrimination outlined in the JDA."

This reflects antisemitic tropes where Jews are falsely accused of causing their own exclusion, aligning with IHRA's examples of systemic discrimination against Jewish groups. While not explicitly hateful, it collectively blames Jews for societal issues, fitting the definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to the exclusion of Jews from ""progressive"" discourse, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jewish individuals. It suggests a systemic issue where Jews are collectively targeted due to their identity, fitting under point 2 and 3 of the guidelines, even without explicit mention of classical stereotypes or Israel-related content.

This meets the criteria outlined by IHRA, including the use of offensive comparisons and stereotyping, which are indicative of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet compares CO2 to Jews in Nazi Germany, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that link Jewish communities to negative historical events. This analogy implies criticism of Israeli policies by drawing a harmful comparison to the Holocaust, thus reflecting antisemitic discrimination against Jews as a group.

It implies a conspiracy-like scenario where Jewish individuals could exert control over international relations, which aligns with antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies.

This targets a specific group and implies that they and others are collectively racist towards Jews. According to the IHRA definition, this can be seen as making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews, thereby aligning with antisemitic rhetoric. By blaming these individuals for racism against Jews, the tweet uses language that dehumanizes and scapegoats a group, fitting the criteria of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references a group known for racist views against Jews and questions Rep.

It implies confusion about what defines being Jewish, which can reinforce negative perceptions tied to classic antisemitic themes.

This aligns with antisemitic beliefs that Jews, including prominent figures like Soros, are seen as collectively exerting hidden influence over events. According to JDA guidelines, such conspiratorial ideas linking Jews to controlling forces behind current events (point 2) and the associated hostile action of attacking a synagogue (point 3) are indicative of antisemitism.
