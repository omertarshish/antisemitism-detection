It's so annoying how they change the term just what they want it to stand for and actually believe what they're spreading all across the Internet.",Yes,"The tweet reflects several elements from the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It asserts that only Jews should define Zionism, implying a stereotype where non-Jews are accused of misusing or distorting the term to harm Jewish communities. By expressing frustration over how others manipulate the term and spread it online, the tweet aligns with examples of antisemitism that accuse non-Jews of conspiring against Jews or Jewish groups. Thus, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic under the provided framework.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that non-Jews are imposing their own definitions of Zionism, potentially implying that Jews cannot define their identity. This aligns with JDA guidelines B.10, which states that denying the right of Jews to exist as Jews is antisemitic.
