Okay, so I need to determine if the given tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what antisemitism is based on the IHRA definition provided. Antisemitism is a perception of Jews that can manifest as hatred towards them. It includes both rhetorical and physical manifestations directed at Jewish individuals or their property, community institutions, religious facilities, etc. The examples given include things like blaming Jews for conspiracies, denying the Holocaust, accusing Jews collectively of actions by others, using stereotypical allegations, and so on.

Now, looking at the tweet: ""Palestinians angry over moves by Bahrain and the UAE to normalize ties with Israel took their protest to the streets of Gaza, burning pictures of the leaders of those three countries as well as President Trump."" So, in this context, Palestinians are protesting against normalization between Israel, Bahrain, the UAE, and the US (as represented by Trump). They're burning pictures of these leaders.

I need to see if this action meets any of the antisemitic criteria. The IHRA examples mention that it's antisemitic to target Jewish or non-Jewish individuals because they are associated with Jews. So, is the act of burning the images of these leaders considered a manifestation directed at Jews?

Wait, the tweet mentions Israel as part of the normalization. Since Israel is a Jewish state, any attack on its symbols or representatives can be linked to antisemitism. The IHRA examples include accusing Jews (or their nation) of being responsible for certain actions or blaming them collectively. But here, the issue seems more about opposition to the normalization rather than directly targeting Jews.

Alternatively, the example mentions that criticism of Israel is not necessarily antisemitic if it's similar to other countries. However, if the criticism involves dehumanizing or stereotypical allegations, then it could be antisemitic. In this case, burning pictures of leaders might be seen as a form of protest against a policy, but does it target Jews?

The tweet doesn't explicitly mention Jews; instead, it's about opposition to normalization with Israel. However, the IHRA examples also include targeting non-Jewish individuals if they are perceived as linked to Jews. For instance, accusing someone of being more loyal to Israel than their own country can be antisemitic.

Wait, in this case, the anger is directed at leaders who have normalized ties with Israel. The act of burning their pictures could be seen as a form of protest, but does it specifically target Jewish individuals or properties? Or is it about opposition to the policy itself?

The key here is whether the targeting is because the individuals are Jewish or because they're associated with actions related to Israel. Since Bahrain and the UAE have normalized ties with Israel, which is a Jewish state, some might associate these countries' leaders with supporting Jewish interests or Israel.

But does that make it antisemitic? The IHRA examples mention that antisemitism can include blaming non-Jews for actions taken by Jews, but here it's about non-Jews (the leaders) being associated with a Jewish state. It might be more about the policy itself rather than targeting Jews.

Wait, another angle: if the protesters are targeting not just the leaders but also Trump because he's associated with supporting Israel, which is a Jewish state. So perhaps the tweet is implying that these leaders and Trump are responsible for actions against Palestinian interests, possibly linking it to antisemitic beliefs about conspiracy or control by Jews.

But I'm not sure if this direct act of burning pictures qualifies as antisemitism unless it's part of a broader pattern of dehumanizing or stereotyping. Alternatively, it could be seen as a form of protest that doesn't necessarily involve antisemitic rhetoric.

I think the crucial point is whether the action targets Jews or Jewish properties. Since the leaders are non-Jewish (Bahrain and UAE leaders), but they're normalizing with Israel, which is Jewish. So their actions might be criticized in various ways, including by Palestinians who may view it as betraying Arab interests.

But the IHRA examples include targeting non-Jewish individuals if they are linked to Jews or Jewish entities. For example, accusing someone of being more loyal to Israel than their own country can be antisemitic. However, this tweet is about opposing normalization, which is a political stance rather than a direct attack on Jews.

Wait, the act of burning their images could be seen as offensive, but it's not necessarily targeting Jews unless it's done with intent to dehumanize or incite hatred towards Jews. If the protesters are only opposing the policy and not expressing antisemitic views about Jews, then it might not be antisemitic.

But in the context of Holocaust remembrance, any act that demonizes or targets Jewish people could be relevant. Since the tweet mentions Gaza, where there's a conflict involving Israel, but I'm still not sure if the act itself is antisemitic.

Alternatively, considering that some antisemitic acts include targeting symbols associated with Jews, even if the individuals aren't Jewish themselves. For example, using Nazi imagery or traditional antisemitic symbols to depict opponents. Here, burning pictures of leaders might be seen as a form of incitement against them because they're associated with supporting Israel.

I think it's a bit ambiguous. On one hand, it's a protest against normalization; on the other, if it's done in a way that dehumanizes or uses antisemitic tropes, then yes. But without explicit antisemitic language, it might be hard to classify it as antisemitic.

Wait, the IHRA examples mention that accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own nation is antisemitic. So if the tweet implies that these leaders are traitors because they normalized with Israel, maybe that's an accusation against them without necessarily targeting Jews directly.

But I'm still not sure. The act of burning their pictures could be a form of protest but doesn't inherently involve antisemitic content unless it's tied to dehumanizing Jews or using stereotypes about them.

I think the key is whether the action targets Jewish individuals or properties. Since the leaders are non-Jewish, but they're associated with a Jewish state, the act might not be directly antisemitic but rather opposition to a policy. However, if it's done in a way that incites hatred against Jews, then it could be considered antisemitic.

In conclusion, I'm leaning towards it not being explicitly antisemitic unless there's more context suggesting the protesters are expressing antisemitic views.
</think>

After carefully considering the context and examples provided by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), the act described in the tweet does not inherently constitute antisemitism. The protest against normalization with Israel involves non-Jewish leaders and is primarily a political stance rather than an attack on Jewish individuals or properties. While opposition to normalization can be complex and emotional, there is no explicit evidence of dehumanizing Jews or using antisemitic tropes in the described action.

**Answer:** The act described does not qualify as antisemitism under IHRA standards.",No,"The tweet describes Palestinians protesting against normalization by burning images of non-Jewish leaders and President Trump. Antisemitism targets Jews specifically, and while the context involves opposition to Israel, the action doesn't attack Jews or Jewish institutions.
