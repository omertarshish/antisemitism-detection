This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by engaging in Holocaust denial or justifying past atrocities against a Jewish group, using historical events to blame or negatively stereotype Jews collectively.",Yes,"The tweet references Hitler's actions against Jews during the Holocaust by stating he had support while committing these atrocities. This directly ties into the JDA guidelines, which consider such depictions and implications as antisemitic. It invokes a negative stereotype about Jewish suffering and aligns with the definition of hostility towards Jews as Jews. Thus, it constitutes antisemitism."

It directs criticism not only at Jews but also at white individuals, aligning with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA. The mention of Jews in a political context and the use of terms suggesting dislike towards white people fit the criteria for antisemitism, which includes targeting Jewish collectives and using negative language against specific groups.",Yes,"The tweet directly targets Jews within the party by name-calling andbullying them, which aligns with guideline 3 of the JDA. Additionally, it makes a sweeping negative generalization about white people, which falls under broader racist statements but primarily focuses on antisemitic content directed at Jews.

It goes against Article 14 A of the Constitution. https://t.co/I8XqAvHblw",No,"The tweet objects to the exclusion of several groups, including Jews, on grounds of religious discrimination. While it mentions Jews specifically, the context is about broader exclusionary practices rather than targeting Jews with hate or antisemitic intent.

Thus, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet addresses an exclusionary practice affecting multiple religious groups, including Jews, but it does not specifically target Jews with antisemitic content or themes.

This aligns with antisemitic rhetoric by dehumanizing Jews and using religious texts to stereotype them as promoters of violence, falling under the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet references Quranic verses and expresses views about religious practice but does not directly incite hatred or violence against Jews. While it discusses specific verses that could be misleadingly used against Jews, it doesn't clearly promote antisemitic tropes or violence.

This statement could imply a coded message about Jewish influence or deceit, falling under the category of indirect or coded antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines. It touches on racial identity in a way that might stigmatize Jews collectively, aligning with points related to discrimination against Jews based on race. Thus, considering the potential for reinforcing negative stereotypes and coded language, this tweet is classified as antisemitic."

It describes a diverse and inclusive church community, mentioning various groups including Jews and Gentiles, Rich and Poor, and Black and White individuals.

The hashtags used are neutral and unrelated to antisemitic content. Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as it focuses on the inclusivity of a church for various groups, including Jews, without promoting negative stereotypes or discrimination.

It is a commentary on media bias and compares treatment of different groups, rather than targeting Jews as a group or promoting harmful stereotypes.

This links violence to negative stereotypes about Jews influencing society, aligning with antisemitic tropes that scapegoat Jewish communities for societal issues. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and blames a specific group for societal changes.",Yes,"The tweet equates Jewish support for refugees with a dilution of ethnic and racial purity in America, which is a form of coded antisemitism. This implies that Jews are negatively influencing demographic changes, a stereotype linked to classical antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence and control.

This approach could be seen as reinforcing stereotypes about Jews by suggesting they are disconnected from their history, which aligns with classic antisemitic tropes. The use of historical context might serve to codedly express antisemitic ideas, targeting Jewish people based on their identity. Thus, the tweet can be considered antisemitic under the JDA guidelines as it potentially marginalizes Jewish communities and implies a stigmatizing view of their identity."

Many Jews (mainly Zionist to be honest) that I have spoken with have indeed called me personally an antisemite because I have criticised Israeli policy regarding Palestine.,No,"The tweet describes an experience where the individual was accused of antisemitism due to criticizing Israeli policies. However, according to IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves specific harmful behaviors such as making stereotypical allegations or denying the Holocaust, which are not detailed in this tweet. The act of criticizing Israeli policy alone does not constitute antisemitism unless it includes prohibited elements. Therefore, without evidence that the criticism involved antisemitic behavior, the tweet is not deemed antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references an experience where some Jews labeled the speaker antisemitic for criticizing Israeli policies. According to JDA guidelines, holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions (point 7) is antisemitic. The recounting of such an experience could perpetuate the stereotype that criticizing Israel equates to antisemitism, thus aligning with point 7. Hence, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it reflects the harmful association of Jewish identity with support for Israeli policies."

If the linked article contains antisemitic content such as negative stereotypes or hate speech targeting Jews, it would violate JDA guidelines by discriminately targeting Jewish identity. Without knowing the exact content, there's a potential for antisemitism based on the risk posed by the link.

It compares this historical context to current political events, using the analogy of Jews being targeted in a step-by-step manner. This comparison aligns with antisemitic tropes by stereotyping and blaming Jews collectively for societal issues. The use of Nazi-like language to dehumanize Jewish people fits the IHRA definition, making the tweet antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic content. It uses a quote about collective silence in the face of oppression, which is a metaphorical expression about political inaction and the need to speak out.

This issue pertains to racial dynamics within the community rather than antisemitism, which targets Jews as a group because of their Jewish identity.

This statement implies an overrepresentation of Jews in a powerful institution, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence and control.
