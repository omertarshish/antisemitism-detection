This reflects antisemitic beliefs as defined by IHRA, making the tweet antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question references a survey finding that 11% of respondents believed Jews caused the Holocaust. This statement directly links Jewish people to an event of immense tragedy, implying Jewish responsibility, which aligns with classic antisemitic conspiracy theories. According to JDA guidelines, denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered antisemitic (point 5). The content here spreads a harmful belief that Jews were involved in such an event, falling under the umbrella of antisemitic ideology as defined by the JDA."

Non Jews have no business wearing it if you ask me,Yes,"The tweet suggests that non-Jews should not wear a symbol that Jews have reclaimed, implying an exclusivity based on Jewish heritage. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes accusations of Jews having exclusive rights to symbols or acts of self-determination. The statement reflects stereotypical beliefs about Jewish ownership and control over certain items, fitting the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet implies that non-Jews should not wear Jewish symbols, which discriminates against individuals based on their religion and restricts their right to express themselves through cultural or religious symbols. This aligns with antisemitic discrimination, as it targets Jews by restricting others from wearing Jewish symbols, thereby limiting their rights and fostering prejudice against non-Jews."

It references anti-Semitic tropes about Jewish conspiracy theories and collective blame, aligning with the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that a person is anti-Christian and implies that she would prevent a Christian from being there. It then questions if it matters if she's Muslim, noting that Muslims, except Omar, hate Christians and Jews. By associating the addressee with someone who hates Jews, the tweet links her to antisemitic sentiments. This aligns with JDA guidelines on coded speech and linking Jews to evil, thus making the statement antisemitic."

We owe a debt of gratitude to those countries who have hosted Jews peacefully.,Yes,"The tweet suggests that non-Jewish countries are owed gratitude for hosting Jews, implying a stereotype where Jews require the goodwill of others. This reduction of Jewish history to being dependent on charity or hospitality reflects antisemitic undertones by dehumanizing Jews as outsiders in need of special treatment.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as per the JDA guidelines. It acknowledges Jewish history and gratitude without any negative stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or harmful actions. It is a factual statement about Jewish settlements in various regions, not an expression of discrimination or hostility against Jews."

This aligns with IHRA's definition as it reflects negative stereotyping and bias against Jewish people, contributing to harmful ideologies.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that singling out Jews is antisemitic. According to the JDA, this reflects a negative stereotype of Jews as a group, aligning with antisemitic principles by targeting Jews collectively and unfairly."

This aligns with antisemitic rhetoric as defined by IHRA, where harmful stereotypes about Jews are employed to demean or attack them. Additionally, the reference to Palestinians hijacking Black Lives Matter could imply an antisemitic undertone by associating a social justice movement with negative actions, potentially targeting Jewish communities indirectly. Thus, both parts of the tweet cross the line into antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet compares Jewish housing to an act of strangulation, using language that associates Jews with harmful actions. This reflects a negative stereotype about Jews, as outlined in JDA guidelines 3 and 4, which identify such comparisons as antisemitic. The implication suggests criticism of Jews is unwarranted, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes and potentially inciting harm through coded speech. Thus, the tweet adheres to JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

However, the tweet does not exhibit any of the hallmarks of antisemitism outlined by IHRA. It does not involve conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial, or use of stereotypes about Jews. Instead, it focuses on political behavior aimed at preventing these groups from voting. Therefore, while it mentions Jews as a targeted group, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",No,"The tweet criticizes Donald Trump's political tactics, which include voter suppression targeting various groups, including Jews. It does not use antisemitic tropes or stereotypes; instead, it includes Jews as part of a broader critique of suppression tactics without implying any negative characteristics based on Jewish identity.

While it uses a sensitive comparison, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism, which involves targeting Jews rather than broader historical criticism.",Yes,"The tweet compares a historical figure's atrocities to Hitler's, which trivializes the Holocaust. It minimizes Jewish suffering by equating it with another genocide. This aligns with JDA guidelines 2 and 5, as it links Jews to evil forces and downplays the Holocaust. Such comparisons reinforce antisemitic stereotypes, making the tweet antisemitic."

It criticizes the school's failure to meet these requirements but does not express hate or stereotype Jews. Therefore, it doesn't align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet discusses the need for public schools to accommodate ""visible Jews"" by providing safety, prayer space, and other resources. While it highlights specific needs for Jewish students, it does not attack or stigmatize Jews. Instead, it critiques the quality of education, focusing on the necessity of meeting certain students' needs.

By highlighting their role in minimizing the Holocaust and persecuting Jewish anti-Nazi activists, it casts them in a negative light that reflects antisemitic stereotypes. This includes blaming non-Jewish leaders for harm done to Jews, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through collective blame and mendacious allegations about Jews as a people.",No,"The tweet discusses historical events involving Soviet leaders, focusing on their treatment of Jewish individuals during and after WWII.

This stance aligns with antisemitic discrimination as defined by IHRA, where certain groups are denied access to platforms or discussions available to others. By prioritizing Jewish individuals in conversations, the tweet promotes a hierarchical and discriminatory mindset, which fits within the broader examples of antisemitic behavior that deny rights or opportunities to specific groups. Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet ""People who are not Jews of color should not be speaking over Jews of color on this."" can be interpreted as imposing restrictions on non-Jews speaking over Jews, which discriminates against Jews based on their identity. This aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA, such as treating Jews as a group that should have an exclusive or higher voice (B.10) and marginalizing them by silencing their contributions in discussions (indirect discrimination). Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic."

It attributes antisemitism to Jews as a collective group, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by accusing them of responsibility for societal issues. This reflects the conspiracy mentality and stereotyping that are indicative of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet contains several antisemitic stereotypes about Jews, including insular behavior, self-interest, ignorance, being backwards, spreading disease, and causing antisemitism. These are classic examples outlined in the JDA's guidelines, specifically guideline 3, which identifies such traits as antisemitic words and imagery. The use of these stereotypes to criticize Jews directly ties into the historical antisemitic tropes of blaming Jewish communities for societal issues, thus falling under the definition of antisemitism as provided by the JDA."

There is no indication of conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial, or harmful stereotypes targeting Jewish individuals.",No,"The tweet references a biblical passage (Acts 20:21) addressing both Jews and Greeks about repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.

This historical claim dehumanizes Arab identity by minimizing their presence and contribution, aligning with antisemitic tropes that prioritize Jewish claims over others. It reduces Arab heritage to a secondary status, reinforcing discriminatory ideas against non-Jewish populations in Israel. Such statements can be seen as antisemitic under IHRA's definition, as they target Jewish identity while dismissing others, fitting examples of dehumanizing or discriminatory rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as it denies the presence of Arabs in Israel before the arrival of Mohammed, implying that Jews have a superior claim to the land. This assertion can be seen as promoting Jewish exclusivity and superiority over others, aligning with classical antisemitic themes that link Jews to a privileged or dominant position. Additionally, by suggesting that Jews' long-term residence justifies their ownership of the land, it could be interpreted as denying Arabs' rights, which is also a form of racial discrimination against non-Jews, in violation of antisemitism guidelines."

This creates a narrative that aligns with stereotypes where Jews are seen as manipulative or accusatory, fitting into IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish communities with harmful rhetoric.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews as a group or attribute antisemitic characteristics to them. While it references historical antisemitism and mentions the ADL, it primarily serves to critique movements or policies rather than attacking Jewish identity. The use of ""tribal interests"" could imply criticism of certain groups but does not inherently equate Jews with negativity or evil, as required for antisemitism under the JDA.

This links Jewish identity with negative traits and criticizes followers of Marx, potentially reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes by associating Judaism with negativity.

The mention of Farrakhan, known for his antisemitic views, further supports the conclusion that this content is antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet employs language that negatively stereotypes Jews, implying they require cleansing through Moses' laws. This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes of Jewish inferiority and the need for purification, which is reinforced by the mention of Farrakhan, a figure associated with antisemitic views.

It reduces Jewish people to actions that imply aggression, fitting the definition of antisemitism by targeting them with negative stereotypes and harmful narratives.",Yes,"The tweet associates Jewish identity with the need for extreme and violent actions (burning NYC) to gain respect, stereotyping Jews in a manner that echoes classic antisemitic tropes. This links Jewishness with disruption and aggression, which aligns with guidelines that identify such language as antisemitic, particularly in how it collectively implicates all Jews in destructive behavior.

Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it reflects anti-Semitic tropes and negatively targets Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet humorously references ""missing Jews of Arab,"" which can be interpreted as a coded or stereotypical remark linking Jews to Arab contexts in a way that might perpetuate negative stereotypes.

While not explicitly targeting Jews, the mention of Holocaust-related content and Jews in the context of censorship implies a potential conspiracy angle (as per IHRA's examples), suggesting Jewish influence in media control. This inference aligns with antisemitic tropes that blame specific groups for societal issues, thus making the tweet antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Holocaust humor, a topic deeply sensitive due to its association with anti-Semitic stereotypes.

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, including blaming Jews for societal issues and using language that dehumanizes or demonizes Jewish individuals.

This generalization targets all Jewish individuals in Israel, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. The phrase suggests collective prejudice and hostility towards Jews based on their ethnicity or religious affiliation, falling under point A1's criticism of making sweeping negative generalizations about a population. Additionally, it implies an opposition to Jewish existence in Israel, akin to point B10's denial of the right of Jews to exist and flourish as Jews. The tweet's language could incite prejudice and is thus consistent with antisemitic rhetoric."
