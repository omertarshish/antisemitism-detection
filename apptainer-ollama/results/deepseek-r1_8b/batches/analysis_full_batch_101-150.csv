According to JDA guidelines, this aligns with classic antisemitic tropes that link Jews or Jewish institutions with evil or negative characteristics.

The comparison made within the tweet, ""I will attempt to ratio the State of Israel with brawl koopa hopping,"" lacks sufficient context and specific reference to Jewish stereotypes or characteristics that would align it with antisemitic ideology. While the term ""ratio"" could imply a negative comparison, without clear evidence linking this comparison to anti-Semitic tropes or intentions, it does not constitute antisemitism as defined by JDA guidelines. Furthermore, the mention of ""brawl koopa hopping"" is ambiguous and does not inherently connect to any specific antisemitic ideas or stereotypes about Jews.
