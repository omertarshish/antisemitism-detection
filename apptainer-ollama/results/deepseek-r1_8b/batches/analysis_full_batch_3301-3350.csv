Holocaust denial is a form of antisemitism as it dehumanizes Jewish people and spreads false information about their suffering. By questioning the accuracy of documented records, such as those cited from the Red Cross, the tweet perpetuates antisemitic stereotypes and undermines the legitimacy of Jewish sufferings during one of the most significant genocides in history. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes denying the Holocaust and its scope, mechanisms, or intentionality.",Yes,"The tweet denies the well-established fact that approximately six million Jews were systematically slaughtered during the Holocaust. According to the JDA, denying or minimizing the Holocaust constitutes antisemitism. By questioning the widely accepted number of victims and citing figures that downplay this tragedy, the tweet aligns with antisemitic discourse. The use of historical data as a basis for this denial is a common tactic among those who seek to undermine the reality of the Holocaust, thereby promoting antisemitic ideology. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria outlined in the JDA guidelines for antisemitism."

This involves accusing a group of collective responsibility for actions taken against them, which fits the criteria of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet implies that the NYPD and LAPD are targeting Hasidic Jews specifically for violating social distancing orders, while also mentioning recreational baseball players. This specific focus on Hasidic Jews suggests a discriminatory enforcement against them based on their Jewish identity. According to JDA guidelines, this constitutes antisemitism as it targets Jews (Hasidic Jews) because of their religious affiliation and Jewish identity without comparable action against others for similar violations. Therefore, the tweet aligns with the definition of antisemitism by disproportionately targeting a Jewish group, potentially reflecting bias or discrimination against them."

It highlights their positive contributions rather than targeting Jews with harmful stereotypes or accusations. Thus, it does not align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which involves hatred, blame, or stereotyping directed at Jews.",No,"The tweet does not reflect antisemitic content as it highlights a positive historical alliance without any negative stereotyping or implications about Jews. It merely acknowledges Jewish involvement in social movements and does not link Jews to harmful stereotypes or conspiracies, thus complying with the JDA guidelines."

It then praises the historical actors responsible for these genocidal acts. According to the IHRA definition, this can be seen as trivializing the Holocaust by equating it with another genocide and diminishing its uniqueness and severity. Such behavior aligns with antisemitic practices, particularly those that deny or downplay the Holocaust's significance. The tweet thus reflects antisemitism by either directly targeting Jews or using comparisons that reflect negatively on Jewish history.",No,"The tweet compares the Holocaust with historical atrocities against Hindus, drawing parallels between Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews and Mughal India's treatment of Hindus. While it uses strong language, it doesn't target Jews directly but refers to historical events. The comparison itself isn't antisemitic as it's about past events and not current or ongoing actions affecting Jews."

It does not contain hate speech or discriminatory language against Jews, nor does it align with the examples provided by IHRA, which typically involve direct attacks on Jewish individuals or communities. Instead, the tweet addresses systemic issues within a community context without targeting Jews specifically.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It expresses frustration about being blamed for antisemitism and experiencing racism within a community, without promoting any antisemitic stereotypes or violence. The focus is on personal experience rather than systemic or collective blaming of Jews."

It compares different groups' experiences regarding their shifting social status in various contexts, including a derogatory term towards Black people. While using ""k*ff*rs"" is problematic, the comparison focuses on race dynamics rather than directly targeting Jews, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet is not antisemitic as per the JDA definition because it does not discriminate against Jews. Instead, it uses racial slurs towards Black individuals, which falls under racism rather than antisemitism. While it references Jewish history, the primary content targets another group with harmful language, making it a case of racism rather than discrimination against Jews."

According to IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves blaming Jews as a collective for societal issues without valid justification. By including Jews alongside white men in a resolution that might imply their equivalence in the context of racism, it could be interpreted as scapegoating or collective blame, aligning with antisemitic tropes. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet describes a resolution that condemns racism against white men and Jews. While it mentions Jews in relation to combating discrimination, it does not use classical antisemitic stereotypes or link Jews to negative forces. Instead, it broadly criticizes both groups, aligning with non-antisemitic examples outlined in the JDA guidelines. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This can be interpreted as diminishing the role of Jews in their own history and reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish dependence on others, which aligns with antisemitic rhetoric by suggesting that Jews cannot survive without external help. Thus, this tweet conforms to the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly contain antisemitic content as defined by the JDA. While it uses confrontational language and implies that Muslims played a role in preserving Jews, there is no direct discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as a group. It instead reflects a historical narrative without reinforcing negative stereotypes or demonstrating hostility towards Jewish people. Therefore, according to the provided guidelines, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism."

This collective accusation based on identity aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming a group for societal issues or being targeted due to their heritage.",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It expresses concern about an incident involving police action against Jews and attributes it to a political figure, but there is no indication of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence specifically directed at Jews as Jews. The content does not involve classical antisemitic tropes, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories, nor does it suggest collective responsibility for the actions of individuals based on their Jewish identity.

However, the content does not directly target Jewish individuals or collectively blame Jews. While there is a historical comparison involving King Cyrus and the Jews, the primary focus of the remarks is on Muslims rather than Jews. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred or persecution directed at Jews, which this tweet does not exemplify. Therefore, based on the analysis, the tweet is not considered antisemitic under the given criteria.",No,"The tweet in question primarily targets Islamic figures rather than Jews or Jewish institutions. While it uses derogatory language (""Imam of Pigs""), the focus is on religious figures from another faith group.

While it may imply special treatment, there's no evidence of antisemitic intent or harmful stereotypes. Thus, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that non-Jews should avoid scheduling meetings on specific ""super important Jewish days,"" implying that these days are so significant for Jews that non-Jews must make accommodations. This could be interpreted as making negative generalizations about Jews' priorities and schedules, which aligns with antisemitic tropes that assume religious practices demand special treatment from others. It may also suggest that Jews' professional lives require non-Jewish coworkers to adjust their calendars, potentially imposing restrictions based on religion rather than individual needs. Thus, the tweet's phrasing could be seen as discriminatory and antisemitic under the JDA definition."
