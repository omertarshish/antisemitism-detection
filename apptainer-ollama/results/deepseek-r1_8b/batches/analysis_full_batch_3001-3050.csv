This places blame on an entire group based on their ethnicity, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism that accuses a collective of responsibility for events they did not directly cause.",Yes,"The tweet is considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition. Specifically, the statement ""holding British Jews accountable for those atrocities = pretty antisemitic"" aligns with guideline B.7 of the JDA, which prohibits treating Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct. This linking of Jewish individuals to the actions of the Israeli state reinforces negative stereotypes and violates the principle of individual responsibility, thus constituting antisemitism."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it collectively targets Jews based on their identity, invoking stereotypes about Jewish victimhood at the hands of ideological groups. The association of Marxism with antisemitism reflects harmful stereotypes, thus qualifying the tweet as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet asserts that Marxists ""hate Jews like night follows day,"" which generalizes a negative stereotype about Marxists as inherently antisemitic.

It quotes Colorado‚Äôs first Jewish governor responding to critics who compared his stay-at-home orders to Nazism. While the comparison made by critics is antisemitic, the tweet itself documents this situation without endorsing or spreading such ideology. According to JDA guidelines, unless the content directly promotes antisemitism, it is not considered antisemitic.

It explicitly mentions ""people who hate Jews"" gathering at Fox News, which targets Jewish individuals and implies a negative perception of Jews as a collective. This aligns with the definition's emphasis on making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews, contributing to their targeted marginalization. The tweet groups various haters under the guise of hating liberals, specifically mentioning anti-Semitic tendencies, thereby spreading antisemitic ideology. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet categorically lists several groups‚Äîblacks, Jews, gays, Latinos, and Muslims‚Äîas being hated by people who gather at Fox News. This grouping implies a negative stereotype of Fox News' audience by associating it with animosity towards these groups. According to the JDA, making sweeping generalizations about a population can be antisemitic, especially when targeting specific ethnic or religious groups like Jews. The inclusion of Jews in this list suggests an association that aligns with antisemitic narratives, making the tweet violate the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This language dehumanizes Jewish individuals by implying an unfair or malicious pursuit, aligning with IHRA's antisemitic criteria as it involves negative stereotypes and targeting based on Jewish identity.",Yes,"The tweet employs language that specifically targets Jewish individuals for their political stance, using terms like ""witch-hunters"" to imply unfair treatment. This language reflects negative stereotypes and can be seen as verbal antisemitism, aligning with the JDA's definition of discrimination against Jews based on their religion. The implication of a hidden agenda or media complicity also ties into classic antisemitic tropes, making the tweet antisemitic."

This comparison can be seen as dehumanizing and stereotyping, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using classic antisemitic symbols or language that demoralizes or negatively portrays Jews as a collective. The statement telling Jews to ""crawl out from under their rocks"" is a stereotype often used in antisemitic contexts, further supporting the conclusion that this tweet is antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet contains antisemitic content by equating Jewish people with members of the KKK, a racist organization, and using derogatory language that targets Jews, particularly those of color. This directly aligns with JDA guidelines which define antisemitism as discrimination against Jews based on their ethnicity. The comparison to the KKK is a racial stereotype that promotes hatred and discrimination, falling under the definition of antisemitism as provided by the JDA."

IHRA defines antisemitism as including applying double standards, which can imply blaming Jewish people or their community. By highlighting inconsistency specifically towards Jews, the tweet aligns withIHRA's examples of antisemitism, singling out Jews and suggesting unfair treatment. This stereotyping and accusation fit the criteria for antisemitic behavior as per IHRA's guidelines.",No,"The tweet critiques the NY Times for a perceived double standard in media sensitivity towards non-majority groups versus Jews. It does not attack Jews or use antisemitic stereotypes but instead addresses a media bias issue.

This belief in Jewish conspiracies constitutes antisemitic perception and imputes collective responsibility on Jews, fitting the criteria outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet references ""Jews 'who rule the world by proxy'"", which reflects the belief in Jewish conspiratorial control over global systems. This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes of Jewish influence and secret power, as defined by the JDA.

This aligns with IHRA's example of antisemitism, where Jews are falsely accused of conspiring to harm others or manipulate groups, such as blaming them for societal issues. By linking this claim to white nationalism, the tweet further illustrates how stereotypes about Jewish influence can be used to promote discriminatory ideologies. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet propagates the antisemitic trope of Jewish manipulation and control over others, specifically targeting Black people. It aligns with classic antisemitic notions of Jews having hidden power and interconnected conspiracies with white nationalism.

This implies an aversion towards Jewish community institutions and individuals based on their support for Israel, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it involves discrimination against Jewish groups.",Yes,"The tweet contains coded language that associates Jewish people supporting Israel with being unsafe in Europe.

According to the IHRA definition, this constitutes antisemitism by associating a person or group with the atrocities committed against Jews, thereby targeting them with harmful stereotypes and false allegations.",Yes,"The tweet equates individuals associated with Transition 46 or a Christian figure with the mass murder of Jews during the Holocaust. This links them to antisemitic stereotypes where Jews are collectively blamed for evil acts ( guideline B.7 ). By associating them with such atrocities, it applies classical antisemitic symbols to Israel and its Jewish people ( guideline C.6 ), thus violating the JDA definition of antisemitism."

It equates current events with historical genocide, drawing a comparison that aligns with harmful stereotypes and Mendacious allegations as outlined by IHRA. By linking individuals to enabling a tyrant and referencing mass deaths, it trivializes the Holocaust and implies collective responsibility, elements consistent with antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet equates individuals who enabled the Holocaust with current actors, using Holocaust imagery to imply a genocidal threat against Jews. It directly links enabling Jewish suffering in both historical and present contexts, aligning with antisemitic themes of blaming Jews for societal ills and using Holocaust analogies to incite fear or hatred against them.

It uses terms like ""Fake Death #Theory"" to imply a Jewish involvement in deceptive actions. While RBG is not Jewish, the mention of ""bad Jews"" and a conspiracy ties into antisemitic stereotypes of Jews conspiring or causing issues. This aligns with IHRA's definition by targeting Jewish stereotypes and implying collective blame, fitting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet appears to be antisemitic under the JDA guidelines. It refers to RBG's death on Constitution Day as ""fake"" and links it to obstructing a case against ""bad Jews."" This implies a conspiracy theory about Jewish individuals collectively acting against someone, which aligns with classic antisemitic stereotypes of Jewish conspiracies (point 2 in JDA). Additionally, questioning the validity of her death could be seen as minimizing historical facts or events, similar to Holocaust denial (point 5 in JDA). Furthermore, holding Jews collectively responsible for actions based on their identity, such as obstructing cases, fits under point 7. These elements collectively indicate antisemitic undertones."

While it primarily critiques a political organization's role in Israel's policies, the call to skip AIPAC could imply stigmatizing Jewish involvement in supporting Israel.
