That was the mistake !",No,"The tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA. It addresses a communication mistake without targeting Jews with hatred, stereotypes, or harmful allegations. The focus is on an incorrect method of announcement rather than any antisemitic content or behavior.",No,"The tweet discusses an error in addressing a Jewish community instead of specifying a location, which is a critique of an event's communication style. It doesn't invoke classical antisemitic stereotypes, financial conspiracy theories, or negative generalizations about Jews. Instead, it focuses on a logistical mistake and is protected as free speech under the JDA guidelines."

This aligns with IHRA's example of denying the Holocaust or its context, suggesting an antisemitic stance by downplaying Jewish suffering.",Yes,"The tweet ""@RahulEaswar It's holy day I should not says what was fate of Jews"" suggests an avoidance of discussing the historical fate of Jews, which could imply a stereotypical or negative perspective on Jewish history. This approach aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that associate Jewish identity with negative outcomes, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes rather than contributing to open and informed dialogue. The choice not to address the topic directly can be interpreted as an indirect form of discrimination against Jews, as it avoids addressing their collective historical context without providing balanced information. Thus, this behavior aligns with the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews based on their identity."

It addresses a broader issue about kindness towards all people, specifically mentioning house help and Jesus's love for them.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly points 6 (accusing Jews of disloyalty) and 9 (holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel). The demand for an apology from ""Jews in general"" further emphasizes the targeting of Jewish identity, fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet in question uses the term ""slur"" and refers to an argument about Israel that appears to target Jews. According to the JDA guidelines, particularly points 7 and 10, antisemitism includes making sweeping generalizations or applying classical stereotypes about Jews, such as collectively blaming them for the actions of Israel. The request to quote the source or apologize suggests a potentially harmful stereotype, aligning with the definition of antisemitism. Therefore, the tweet is deemed antisemitic based on the provided guidelines."

It suggests that ""Americans"" killed refer to Jews from Israel, implying a conspiracy or blame on Jewish individuals. Additionally, equating ""America"" with the American-Israeli regime suggests Jewish influence and control over the country, reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies and dominance. This language targets Jewish people and fits within IHRA's definition of antisemitism by promoting negative perceptions and stereotypes about Jews.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews from Israel are responsible for violence against Americans and redefines ""America"" as an entity controlled by Israelis. This aligns with JDA points 2, 6, and 7, which identify antisemitism through blaming Jewish groups for negative actions and linking them to controlling influences, thus constituting discrimination against Jews."

Now you know.",Yes,"The tweet equates Zionists with Nazis and jihadis as threats to Jews.

It compares the threat to Jews to Zionists rather than Nazis or jihadis, implying that Zionists are a comparable threat. By associating Zionists with hating Jews and suggesting that Jews are being used as statistics to further some agenda (as inferred from the Holocaust reference), the tweet engages in coded antisemitic language. The comparison to the Holocaust is particularly distressing, as it trivializes and relates to antisemitic conspiracy theories and Holocaust denial, both of which are explicitly listed as antisemitic behaviors. Additionally, the implication that Jews are collectively being exploited fits within guidelines that highlight the collective responsibility placed on Jews due to their identity, another form of antisemitism. Thus, the tweet violates multiple aspects of the JDA's definition and guidelines."

This differential treatment aligns with antisemitic tropes that demean non-Christians, particularly Jews and Muslims, when they express their faith. Such comparisons reinforce harmful stereotypes and fit within IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting individuals based on their religious identity with negative and dehumanizing language.",Yes,"The tweet reflects antisemitic bias by generalizing negatively about Jews and Muslims based on their religion. It treats their religious practices as inherently extremist or cult-like, which are harmful stereotypes that align with classical antisemitic notions of stigmatizing non-Christians. This constitutes discrimination against Jewish and Muslim individuals simply for their faith, thereby adhering to the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

They blatantly broke the law and put my life and my fellow New Yorker’s life in danger. I couldn’t be prouder of what mayor Deblasio did and said.,Yes,"The tweet in question applies several antisemitic tropes as defined by IHRA. It targets Hasidic Jews by name and accuses them collectively of disregarding public health during the pandemic, implying they are more concerned with their own interests than others'. This aligns with examples such as blaming a group for societal issues or accusing them of irresponsible behavior. The tweet uses stereotypes about Jewish gatherings during crises, which resonate with antisemitic narratives that scapegoat Jews for societal problems. Additionally, it denies opportunities to a Jewish community by faulting their actions without evidence, another indicator of antisemitism. Thus, the content meets several criteria for being antisemitic as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet targets ""Hasidic Jews"" by accusing them of breaking the law and endangering others during the pandemic. This reflects a negative stereotype that singles out Jews based on their religious identity, which aligns with antisemitic tropes of blaming specific groups for societal issues. The mention of Mayor De Blasio's praise doesn't negate the underlying hostility towards Hasidic Jews, as it focuses on their behavior without acknowledging individual responsibility or external factors. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It was the only factor in my vote.,Yes,"The tweet suggests that the voter's primary motivation was ensuring Jewish safety, which can imply a preference for Jewish interests over others.

This deceptive behavior mimics Jewish identity for malicious purposes, aligning with antisemitic tactics such as impersonation and mendacious accusations.
