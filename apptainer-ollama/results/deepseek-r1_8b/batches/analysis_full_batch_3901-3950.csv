It accurately recounts her experience without any hate speech, false accusations, or targeting of Jewish individuals or communities. The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, as it is neutral and based on historical truth.",No,"The tweet provides a factual account of Françoise Sukno's tragic fate during the Holocaust. It does not contain any discriminatory content, nor does it generalize or stereotype Jewish people.

This than results in anti semitism being raised and Jews being targeted. Just because whats happening in Israel doesn’t give a right to attack Jews",No,"The tweet criticizes media portrayal of Israel without targeting Jews or using harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories. It expresses concern about media bias but clarifies that attacking Jews is not justified. This does not align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which requires targeting of Jews based on harmful perceptions or actions against them.",Yes,"The tweet suggests a connection between criticism of Israel and antisemitism directed at Jews. It implies that targeting Jews occurs as a result of Israel's portrayal by media, conflating the state's actions with Jewish identity. This aligns with guidelines B.7 and B.10, which outline how holding Jews responsible for Israel's conduct or denying their right to exist as Jews is antisemitic. The tweet indirectly targets Jews by linking criticism of Israel to anti-Semitic behavior, thus fulfilling the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA."

This framing uses conspiracy-like accusations and collectively blames a group (Palestinians) for harmful actions against Jews, fitting IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly states that Palestinian protests were argued in court to be racist and antisemitic, with a specific claim that these protests aimed to ""kill the Jews."" This directly links Palestinian protesters to intent against Jews, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination or hostility against Jews. It falls under direct antisemitic speech by associating a group with harmful intent towards Jews, violating guidelines that condemn such associations and hostile acts."

It also risks reinforcing stereotypes by blaming a group for issues related to Jewish self-determination. This approach meets IHRA's criteria for antisemitism as it targets Jewish collectives through harmful generalizations.",Yes,"The tweet suggests a separation of Jewish identity from Zionism and implies that the problem lies with Zionists rather than Jews. This distinction could reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish identity by implying that some Jewish people are problematic, thereby aligning with antisemitic narratives that link Jews to conspiratorial or harmful groups (point 2). Additionally, it may deny the legitimate existence of Jews in Israel as part of point 10's criteria, contributing to an overall stance that could be interpreted as antisemitic. The use of #FreePalestine alongside these statements might also be seen as a coded form of antisemitic speech, reinforcing the idea that Jewish identity is separate from support for Israeli policies, which can feed into negative stereotypes and thus falls under the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This compares modern Jewish policies to those of Nazi Germany and uses harmful stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies and collective responsibility, all of which align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet draws a comparison between Christian supporters of Israel and historical antisemitic actions, equating them with those who expelled Jews under minority Zionism. This aligns with JDA guidelines that classify such use of classical antisemitic motifs as antisemitic, particularly applying negative stereotypes about Jewish influence."

It does not exhibit hateful rhetoric, stereotyping, or targeting of Jews as per the IHRA definition. The content reflects a debate within the Jewish community rather than an antisemitic viewpoint.",No,"The tweet discusses internal Jewish dissent regarding a decision or policy, reflecting differing religious perspectives without targeting Jews negatively.

This chant advocates for harm against Jews and employs anti-Semitic tropes, aligning with the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it promotes hatred towards Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet refers to a chant that glorifies the Battle of Khaybar, a historical event where Jewish tribes were defeated by Muslim forces led by Mohammed. This chant uses the memory of past violence against Jews to incite hatred and reinforce antisemitic stereotypes. According to the JDA guidelines, particularly point B.6, applying classical antisemitic symbols and negative stereotypes to Israel is problematic. The mention of ""Mohammad's army returning"" suggests an association with historical persecution of Jews, aligning with the antisemitic narrative that Jews are linked to forces of evil or threat. Thus, this chant crosses into antisemitic territory by invoking past violence against Jews in a way that incites hatred and reinforces harmful stereotypes."

It critiques a political movement and uses historical context to highlight opposition, but it doesn't target Jews with conspiracy theories, deny the Holocaust, or blame Jewish collective responsibility. Instead, it draws an analogy about the persistence of certain ideologies, focusing on political critique rather than antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly blame Jewish people for any wrongdoing or link them with negative stereotypes. Instead, it uses their historical struggle against fascism as a metaphor to critique a political movement associated with white supremacy and fascism.

So why are you so persistent in saying that Palestine is the homeland of the Jews since King David when you have admitted that the current Jews are probably not in the same lineage? https://t.co/bGuX2K3Cpv,Yes,"The tweet questions the historical continuity of Jewish identity by suggesting that modern Jews are not from the same lineage as those during King David's time. This implies a denial or diminishment of Jewish collective identity, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes and dehumanizing notions about Jewish peoplehood. By challenging the historical connection to Palestine, it reinforces harmful stereotypes about the legitimacy of Jewish national claims, contributing to an antisemitic narrative.",Yes,"The tweet questions the historical continuity of Jewish identity by suggesting that current Jews are not descendants of King David's time. This challenges the notion of a continuous Jewish presence in Palestine/Israel, potentially undermining Jewish claims to a historical connection. While it doesn't use classical antisemitic imagery, it touches on a sensitive topic that could be used to advance negative stereotypes about Jewish identity and belonging. The JDA guidelines indicate that denying or minimizing Jewish collective identity can be considered antisemitic, especially when it relates to racializing or demeaning Jews as a group. Therefore, this tweet aligns with antisemitic principles by questioning the lineage and thus the legitimacy of Jewish claims to a homeland in Palestine/Israel."

This aligns with antisemitic tropes that blame Jews for societal issues or exploiting their position, as outlined by IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet employs language that reflects negative stereotypes about Jewish people, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes such as financial manipulation and collective responsibility.

This targeting of Jewish individuals based on their identity aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes actions that dehumanize or exclude Jews as a group. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it implies discrimination against Jewish socialists.",Yes,"The tweet mentions Labour expelling Ken Loach and purging Jewish socialists. This implies targeting individuals based on their Jewish identity, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism by discriminating against Jews for being Jewish. It reflects a negative stereotype and potential forced conformity, consistent with guidelines that prohibit such discrimination."

It does not target Jews collectively or use harmful stereotypes or dehumanizing language. Instead, it provides historical context related to an individual's heritage without antisemitic implications.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior under the JDA definition. It references a literary character and discusses the creator's Jewish background without using derogatory language or promoting hatred.

Antisemitism often involves using negative stereotypes about Jewish characteristics, such as greed or conspiracy, to demean or degrade Jewish individuals. By associating Jews with an obsessive love for money, the tweet contributes to a dismissive and prejudiced view of Jewish people. While it may be intended as humor, it still adheres to the IHRA definition by perpetuating negative stereotypes about Jews, making it antisemitic.",No,"The tweet references Jewish stereotypes about money but uses humor and self-deprecation to neutralize any potential antisemitic implications. It doesn't present a harmful or discriminatory stance against Jews, so it doesn't qualify as antisemitic under the JDA definition."

This implies that numerical data is used to discuss the alienation of Jewish individuals, which can reinforce antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish influence or control. According to IHRA, this targets Jewish communities with negative implications, fitting into the category of antisemitic discrimination or stereotyping. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question suggests that Labour's actions are alienating British Jews, specifically referencing ""numbers."" This phrasing implies a stereotype about Jewish influence or control, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes. By targeting Jewish people based on their identity through mention of their community being affected, the tweet engages in discrimination against Jews as Jews, thus adhering to antisemitic definitions under the JDA guidelines."

It falsely accuses Israeli Jews of using Palestinian children's blood to make matzo, which is a classic antisemitic stereotype used historically against Jewish communities. Even though the statement is phrased as a joke, it perpetuates harmful and bigoted ideas that target Jews for being Jewish. This aligns with the JDA guidelines, specifically guideline B.10, which states that antisemitism can manifest in direct or indirect forms, including using historical stereotypes to stigmatize Jews.

It mentions Waseem Awawdeh, who was arrested for attacking a Jew, and implies he is now free to hunt Jews again. Phrases like ""open season on Jews"" and ""hunting Jews"" incite fear and support violence against Jewish individuals. According to IHRA's definition, this constitutes antisemitism as it involves rhetoric targeting Jews for harm, aligning with the organization's examples of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet implies an ongoing threat against Jews in NYC by referencing an attack and suggesting continued danger. This promotes fear and suggests a hostile environment towards Jewish individuals, aligning with definitions of antisemitism as hostility or discrimination against Jews. The content directly associates a violent act against a Jew and indicates that the attacker remains free to target others, which fits within the guidelines provided by the JDA."
