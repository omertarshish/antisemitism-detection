According to the JDA guidelines, particularly points 13 and 14, this type of criticism or protest against Israeli policies does not constitute antisemitism since it does not target Jews or Jewish institutions but rather addresses Israeli actions and policies.

While the language employed is ominous, the content does not directly relate to Jewish individuals or involve antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or dehumanizing remarks about Jews.

This aligns with IHRA's example of accusing individuals of wrongdoing because of their Jewish ties, constituting antisemitism by associating negative behavior with Jewish identity.",Yes,"The tweet references Nuland's marriage to a Jewish Zionist and implies that her actions are influenced by this relationship, suggesting Jewish undue influence. This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes of Jews possessing hidden power, as outlined in JDA guidelines. The mention of Zionism in a negative context, along with the implication of Jewish political influence, constitutes coded speech that reflects antisemitic ideas about Jewish conspiracies and control, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA definition."

While the language is strong, it primarily targets Israeli actions rather than the Jewish people or community. According to IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews and can include targeting Jewish collectivities like Israel. However, mere criticism of Israeli policies, even if harsh, does not inherently qualify as antisemitic unless it incorporates hate speech or conspiracy theories directed at Jews. In this case, the tweet addresses Israeli policy without referencing Jews in a hateful manner, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's guidelines.",No,"The tweet is critical of Israeli policy regarding the annexation of land in the West Bank.

By asserting that Israel does not exist as a country, the statement denies the legitimacy of Israel, which directly impacts the rights of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish collectively. This aligns with point 10 of the JDA guidelines, which identifies such denial as antisemitic, as it targets Jewish identity and collective rights. The tweet's explicit denial of Israel's existence can be interpreted as an attack on the Jewish people's right to national identity and presence in their homeland.
