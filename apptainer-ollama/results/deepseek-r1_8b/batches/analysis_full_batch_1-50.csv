It focuses on the policies and conduct of the Israeli state, which is permissible under the JDA guidelines as it allows for evidence-based criticism without stigmatizing Jews.

IHRA defines antisemitism as including conspiracy theories targeting Jewish individuals or groups. By replacing Jews with Jesuits in this context, the tweet still aligns with antisemitic stereotypes, thereby falling under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet substitutes Jesuits for Jews in a conspiracy theory about controlling Israel. This mirrors classic antisemitic tropes where a specific group is falsely accused of secret control. By replacing Jews with Jesuits, it implies a similar narrative of hidden influence, aligning with antisemitic ideologies as defined by the JDA guidelines."

It’s antisemetic to challenge the existence of the Jewish community and it’s people not a governments action",Yes,"The tweet asserts that challenging the existence of the Jewish community and its people is antisemitic. This aligns with IHRA's definition as it denies the Jewish people's right to self-determination and perceiving Jews in a negative, harmful way. Such statements reflect antisemitic ideology by reducing Jews to mere objects of criticism or denial, fitting the outlined criteria.",Yes,"The tweet equates any challenge to the Israeli government with antisemitism and asserts that challenging the existence of the Jewish community is antisemitic. According to the JDA, antisemitism involves targeting Jews as a group rather than their policies. The statement implies that criticizing the Jewish community's existence is inherently antisemitic, aligning with classical stereotypes and conflating political criticism with bigotry towards Jews. Thus, this tweet adheres to the definition of antisemitism as it targets the Jewish community's identity."

TheIHRA definition requires intent to demean or harm Jews, which isn't present here. Therefore, it doesn't qualify as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Israel's actions are responsible for stirring up anti-Semitic sentiments. While it does not explicitly target Jews directly, the association of Israeli actions with anti-Semitism can be interpreted as linking Jewish influence to negative outcomes, in line with classic antisemitic tropes.
