According to the JDA definition, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. This tweet does not exhibit any of these elements; instead, it appears to celebrate a particular type of Jew. While there is an inherent risk in making broad generalizations about Jewish people (as noted in guideline A1), the context here seems to be a positive expression rather than one that demeans or attacks Jewish individuals. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It uses stereotypes about Jewish collective power and influence, implying Jews have undue control over key societal sectors like media, politics, and banking. This reflects antisemitic tropes where Jews are blamed for societal issues or accused of conspiratorial control. The statement also dehumanizes non-Jews by suggesting their irrelevance, contributing to a perception of Jewish dominance and exclusion, thus qualifying as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Jewish collective power across various sectors such as advocacy organizations, banking, media, and politics, which aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes of a Jewish conspiracy.

It also references historical persecution and the adaptation of Jewish holidays into Christianity, which aligns with IHRA's examples of dehumanizing allegations against Jews and their contributions to cultural heritage. This reflects a negative perception of Jews as a people and their role in shaping Christian culture, thus fitting the definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet discusses historical and cultural adaptation from Judaism to Christianity, such as the adoption of holidays like Easter and Pentecost. While it acknowledges that many Jews have died due to Christian influence, it does not explicitly target Jews as a group with prejudice or discrimination but rather addresses a historical context.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves applying negative stereotypes about Jews or Judaism in a derogatory context.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Trump as ""King of Jews,"" which links his success and influence to Jewish identity. This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes that associate Jews with power or conspiratorial control, as outlined in the JDA guidelines. The term suggests a stereotypical link between being Jewish and having undue influence, reinforcing negative stereotypes. While it doesn't explicitly attack Jews, the explicit association of a non-Jewish individual with Jewish identity in a stereotypical manner constitutes antisemitism under the JDA's definition."

This aligns with antisemitic tropes by framing cultural differences as shortcomings, indirectly targeting Jewish communities and reinforcing negative perceptions of non-Jews.",Yes,"The tweet can be interpreted as indirectly implying that non-Jews' culture is flawed because they are asked to follow simple ethical requests from Israel. This reflects a form of coded antisemitism by associating non-Jewish behavior with failure to meet ethical standards linked to Jewish institutions, thus potentially targeting Jews or Jewish institutions in an indirect manner."

It employs stereotypes about Jews' intellectual prowess and potential for both good and evil, which can be seen as contributing to negative antisemitic tropes. Additionally, it discusses Croatians using antisemitism as a tactic, implying manipulation or deception, which fits the IHRA's categorization of antisemitic behavior. Although the tweet concludes by affirming Serbian Jews' positivity, the overall context and use of stereotypes indicate an underlying antisemitic tone.

It refers to ""Serbian anti-Semitism"" and links it with Croatian subversion, suggesting that Serbs are involved in anti-Semitic actions. Additionally, the statement about Jews having potential for both good and evil can reinforce negative stereotypes by implying Jewish involvement in harmful actions. While the tweet also mentions the positive contributions of Serbian Jews, the overall tone and content align with principles outlined in the JDA that identify such statements as potentially antisemitic, especially considering the broader context of linking Jewish traits to negativity."

This connects to IHRA examples of blaming or disproportionately focusing on Jews, suggesting a negative stereotype.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that the NYPD is being used to over-policing visibly Jewish individuals after having over-policing Black and brown New Yorkers in the name of defending Jews. This implies targeting Jewish people based on their appearance, which can be seen as racial profiling and reinforces antisemitic stereotypes by disproportionately focusing on Jewish individuals, thus constituting discrimination against Jews as Jews."

While it mentions Jewish suffering, it does not explicitly express hatred or employ harmful stereotypes typical of antisemitism as defined by IHRA. The focus seems to be on historical contexts rather than demeaning or attacking Jews. Therefore, based on the provided criteria, this tweet does not meet the thresholds for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet invokes historical contexts of persecution and coexistence to imply a coded message about Jewish influence leading to current conflicts. While not explicitly targeting Jews, the reference to past harmony and present negativity aligns with guidelines that link Jews to evil forces or conspiracy theories, fitting the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews."

This comparison dehumanizes Jewish individuals and implies a negative perception of them, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet compares the hatred towards Hercegovac and Jews by stating that both are equally disliked and mistrusted. This comparison could be seen as an analogy linking two different groups as being hated in a similar fashion, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. By equating the dislike for one group (Hercegovac) with the dislike for Jewish people, the tweet reflects a form of discrimination against Jewish individuals, fitting within the framework of antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA."

It perpetuates stereotypical notions about Jewish behavior by suggesting that Jews are only genuinely patriotic when facing enemies and become critical otherwise. This reflects antisemitic tropes of disloyalty and criticism without justification.
