Instead, it honors the victims by highlighting this tragic part of history, which aligns with remembering and preventing future atrocities rather than promoting antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. It accurately recounts a historical event, the V√©lodrome roundup of Jews during the Holocaust, and reflects on the importance of remembering these victims.

It upholds a dangerous stereotype and the police KNOW this. They‚Äôre trying to divide us.,Yes,"The tweet expresses a stereotype that Jews are enemies of Black folks despite supporting them, which aligns with harmful antisemitic notions. It implies a negative perception of Jewish identity and loyalty, contributing to antisemitic sentiment. This aligns with the IHRA definition by targeting Jewish individuals with negative stereotypes and implying disloyalty, thus fitting within the framework of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question applies negative stereotypes suggesting that Jews are enemies of Black folks, which promotes harmful generalizations about Jewish identity. By implying that Jews are opposed to Black individuals and that this opposition is being exploited by authorities to create division, the tweet targets Jewish people based on their ethnicity, aligning with antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. This includes making sweeping negative judgments about a population (Jews) and invoking stereotypes that can incite hostility or discrimination against them."

It implies that anger is directed at Jews, aligning with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which encompasses rhetoric that targets Jewish individuals or groups. The use of hashtags like ""#antisemitism #jews"" further indicates an intention to spread antisemitic messages, making this tweet a clear example of antisemitic expression.",Yes,"The tweet expresses a concern that blacks and whites may persecute Jews due to their anger. This statement targets Jewish people based on their identity, fulfilling the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. While it doesn't explicitly reference classic antisemitic tropes, it suggests persecution directed at Jews, aligning with the JDA's categorization of direct verbal hostility. The use of hashtags like #antisemitism confirms the context, making this clearly an antisemitic statement."

According to IHRA's definition, if these statements contain mendacious, stereotypical allegations or collectively blame other Jews for wrongdoing, they can be classified as antisemitic. This aligns with examples like making negative stereotypes about Jews as a group and accusing them of responsibility for real or imagined issues, which falls under the scope of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to ""right wing jews"" and their negative remarks about other jews, potentially implying that these right-wing Jewish individuals are being criticized or targeted based on their political stance. According to the JDA, antisemitism involves targeting Jews for their identity or beliefs in a way that can incite hostility. By highlighting such remarks, the tweet could foster or promote negativity towards these individuals solely because of their Jewish identity and associated beliefs, thus aligning with antisemitic principles as defined by the JDA."

While these incidents are examples of anti-Semitism as defined by IHRA, the tweet does not express or promote hatred towards Jews but instead informs about such events. Therefore, it is not itself antisemitic.",No,"The tweet reports on anti-Semitic incidents against American Jews, specifically noting increased attacks on Jewish sites and individuals. According to the JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination or hostility directed at Jews as Jews. Here, the tweet is factual without targeting Jews for being Jewish in a derogatory manner; instead, it highlights incidents that affect the Jewish community. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria of antisemitism as defined by JDA."

They continue to exploit us &amp; control Black celebs,so-called leaders &amp; even elected officials.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language (""fake Jews"") and makes sweeping, unsupported accusations that imply Jewish collective responsibility for historical and current injustices. It aligns with IHRA examples of mendacious allegations about Jewish control and stereotyping, targeting Jewish individuals and groups. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question makes several statements that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It essentializes Jewish people by accusing them collectively of exploiting Black communities, controlling influential figures, and not apologizing for historical wrongs. This reflects antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies and control over others, which are explicitly covered under the JDA's guidelines as examples of antisemitism. The language used directly targets Jews with racialized accusations, falling under both direct and indirect forms of antisemitic speech. Therefore, the tweet is identified as antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

He‚Äôs an anti-Semite!‚Äù\n\nFarrakhan: https://t.co/zQxfUxfZmh,Yes,"The tweet references Louis Farrakhan's antisemitic remarks and includes a link to a video that likely contains his hateful rhetoric. Antisemitism involves expressing hatred towards Jews, whether through words or actions, especially when it targets Jewish individuals or communities. Farrakhan's history of making antisemitic statements aligns with the IHRA definition, which categorizes such behavior as antisemitic. By promoting and linking to content that supports his views, the tweet contributes to spreading antisemitism, thereby fulfilling the criteria outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet associates Minister Farrakhan with antisemitism by implying he hates Jews. This invokes classic antisemitic stereotypes (linking Jews to evil) and promotes a negative generalization about his views on Jews, in line with JDA guidelines A2 and A1. His actions could be seen as contributing to coded speech that reflects such biases, thereby fulfilling the criteria for antisemitism."

It aligns with combating antisemitism by highlighting heroism rather than exhibiting any hateful or discriminatory behavior towards Jews.

Instead, it celebrates acts of kindness and resistance against oppression.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA.

They embrace today's nihilistic culture where they want nothing more than to tear down everything it means to be a Jew.,Yes,"The tweet describes self-loathing Jews rejecting their heritage and embracing nihilism, which can be seen as a form of dehumanizing or mendacious accusation against the Jewish community. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism by stereotyping and negatively depicting Jewish identity, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitic content.",Yes,"The tweet references ""self-loathing Jews"" who despise their Jewish heritage, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes (guideline A.3). It also implies that these individuals are working to dismantle Jewish identity, falling under the category of denying their right to exist as Jews (guideline B.10). This targets Jews based on their identity and promotes a hostile view, meeting the criteria for antisemitism."

It accuses him of murdering Jews and others, labels him a ""War Criminal"" and ""WANTED TERRORIST,"" and highlights his transition from being a self-proclaimed terrorist to a Nobel Peace Prize recipient. This implies a negative stereotype about Jews holding positions of power and suggests collective blame for his actions on the Jewish community. Such rhetoric aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews as a people for wrongdoing and using dehumanizing language against them.",Yes,"The tweet targets Menachem Begin specifically for his Jewish identity, associating him with criminal acts and terrorism. This links his Jewish heritage to negative stereotypes, aligning with antisemitic tropes where Jews are unfairly blamed for crimes. The tweet's focus on his Jewishness while accusing him of heinous acts violates the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination against individuals based on their Jewish identity. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic."

This directly targets Jewish individuals, invoking classical antisemitic tropes and dehumanizing them by attributing blame to an entire group based on religious beliefs. The use of this specific hadith is a well-documented example of antisemitism, as it curses Jews collectively and serves to incite hatred towards them. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes dehumanizing and blaming Jews for imagined wrongdoing, often using religious texts to legitimize such sentiments. Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question quotes a Hadith that curses both Jews and Christians for their religious practices related to grave veneration. According to the JDA definition, antisemitism involves discrimination or hostility directed at Jews as a group because of their ethnicity or religion. Here, the curse is directed at both Jews and Christians based on specific religious actions (grave veneration). The criticism targets a practice rather than the people for being Jewish, making it a matter of religious critique rather than antisemitism. Thus, under the JDA guidelines, this does not constitute antisemitic behavior as defined."

This statement reinforces negative perceptions of Jews being inevitably targeted because of their ethnicity, contributing to the propagation of antisemitic attitudes.",Yes,"The tweet asserts that all Jews will always face gentile hatred. This is a sweeping negative generalization about the Jewish population, treating it as inherent and promoting prejudice against Jews as a group. According to JDA guidelines, such statements are considered antisemitic because they generalize and stereotype Jews negatively, potentially fostering discrimination or hostility. The content reflects a view that being Jewish inherently leads to opposition, aligning with classic antisemitic tropes about Jews facing inevitable hatred from others."

So the real question is - why are you lying to your readers? Out of ignorance or hateful prejudice? https://t.co/FJzV0KuYOz https://t.co/uiUyEhYgTC,Yes,"The tweet references ""antisemitic conspiracy theories,"" which are part of the IHRA-defined antisemitic discourse. It implies that the media outlet is propagating such theories, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish communities. By associating these theories with the outlet and questioning its integrity with prejudice, the tweet aligns with antisemitic language that targets Jews. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitism as per IHRA guidelines.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jewish people but uses terms like ""antisemitic conspiracy theories"" and questions the intent behind someone's actions. It references that even Polish Jews have condemned such practices, suggesting a critical stance rather than direct antisemitism. While it employs language associated with antisemitism, its primary intention is to critique another person's perspective without directly attacking Jewish individuals or their institutions. Thus, under the JDA definition, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes stereotyping and accusations against Jewish people as a collective. By associating Black people with such narratives, the tweet may imply conspiracy theories or negative attributes, thus crossing into antisemitic territory.",Yes,"The tweet uses language that targets Jewish identity, including the term ""original black Jews,"" which can imply negative stereotypes about Jewish people. The aggressive tone and mention of religious concepts like ""Elohim"" could be seen as mocking or demeaning, aligning with antisemitic speech as defined by the JDA guidelines. This content goes beyond criticism to target Jewish identity directly, fitting into categories such as stereotyping and hostility towards Jews as outlined in the guidelines."

This aligns with antisemitic tropes where Jews are collectively blamed for situations, such as supporting a group that may be perceived as causing them harm. It targets Jewish individuals based on their political choices, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes and blaming them for their circumstances. Therefore, this tweet fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it targets Jews with harmful accusations or implications about their collective actions.",Yes,"The tweet implies that liberal-minded Jews are being betrayed or harmed by the Democrats they support, suggesting a hidden agenda or influence. This aligns with antisemitic tropes about Jewish collective responsibility and manipulation, falling under guidelines 4 (coded speech) and 7 (collective responsibility)."

There are only Moroccan subjects. Not a single Moroccan Jew was deported or killed https://t.co/tRWMsPJYCz",Yes,"The tweet includes statements denying the existence of Moroccan Jews during the Nazi era, which aligns with Holocaust denial as outlined in IHRA's examples. This denial reflects a perspective that disregards the historical suffering of Jewish people, thereby fitting the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet denies the existence of Moroccan Jews during the Holocaust and collaborates with Nazi actions against them. This aligns with JDA's points on Holocaust denial (point 5) and antisemitic generalizations about Jews (point 3), making it antisemitic."

While it highlights an overreaction or negative response, it does not directly target Jewish individuals or community institutions. The focus is on discrimination against brahmins, not Jews. Antisemitism as defined by IHRA involves targeting Jewish people, which isn't the case here. Thus, the tweet doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly target Jews as per the JDA definition of antisemitism. It compares the acceptance of various religious practices across different groups and highlights the negative reaction to a specific Hindu practice, but it doesn't directly associate this with antisemitic stereotypes or hostility towards Jews. The focus is on cultural commentary rather than discrimination against Jewish people."

It conflates Jews with the State of Israel, implying that Keir Starmer's actions against Rebecca Long-Bailey are influenced by a loyalty to Israel over his own country's interests. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, such as accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their nation. The tweet also suggests a stereotype about Jews having undue influence, and it references the Labour Party's adherence to IHRA's code, reinforcing the antisemitic nature of the statement. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet appears to conflate Jewish identity with the State of Israel and suggests that Rebecca Long-Bailey's dismissal is linked to her perceived support for Palestinian rights, which could align with JDA guidelines that identify such behavior as antisemitic. Specifically, it seems to involve holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct, in line with B7 of the JDA, where Jews are treated as agents of Israel due to their Jewish identity. This conflation and collective responsibility, coupled with the mention of Labour's code, suggests an application of classical antisemitic tropes, making the tweet antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

By referencing the act of making Jews kneel as a gesture of submission and humiliation, the tweet evokes the traumatic history of antisemitism and applies it to a modern context. This approach not only trivializes the atrocities committed against Jews by the Nazis but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and associations. The use of historical trauma to characterize a political or social stance can be seen as an attempt to dehumanize and demonize Jewish people or their collective memory, thus conforming to the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Furthermore, the inclusion of a photograph from 1938 adds weight to this comparison, making it more explicit and overtly antisemitic. By invoking such historical precedents, the tweet not only perpetuates antisemitic rhetoric but also risks associating contemporary issues with the oppressive actions of a genocidal regime, thereby spreading hate and misinformation.",Yes,"The tweet references the historical persecution of Jews under Nazi Germany, specifically their forced kneeling as a gesture of submission. This invokes a specific instance of antisemitic behavior from history. By drawing a parallel between past actions and a current act of kneeling, the tweet links Jews to a situation of humiliation, which is an element of antisemitism. The reference to historical precedent could promote the idea that Jews are subjected to such treatment, thereby reinforcing stereotypes or prejudice against them as a group. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in its use of historical context to imply discrimination or hostility towards Jews."

This aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA, such as making harmful generalizations about Jews and denying their identity as Semites. The use of derogatory language towards Jewish people further qualifies it as antisemitic discrimination against Jews as Jews."

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, specifically as it fits into making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective. Such claims perpetuate harmful stereotypes and fall under the category of antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet references Marlon Brando's statement implying that Hollywood is controlled by Jews, which aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish power and control.

By associating Zionism with racism and suggesting self-hatred among Jews, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes and thus qualifies as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jewish people hate Zionists, thereby linking Jews collectively to a negative stereotype. It applies classical antisemitic tropes by associating Jewish individuals with racist behavior through the term ""Zionists."" This aligns with JDA guidelines that consider such statements as antisemitic, particularly as they stigmatize Jews and relate them to harmful stereotypes or collective blame. The tweet's implication that Jews are inherently against Zionists reinforces harmful generalizations, fitting under guidelines 6 and 7 of the JDA, which address antisemitism targeting Jewish individuals based on Israel's conduct.

While not explicitly antisemitic, it uses a highly sensitive historical event to make a point, potentially trivializing the Holocaust and linking it to criticism against inaction, which can be seen as exploiting their suffering for rhetorical purposes. This approach may inadvertently contribute to antisemitic stereotypes by associating Jews with trauma or responsibility, thereby violating the JDA guidelines that prohibit minimizing or exploited use of such historical atrocities."

This shifts the focus from individuals to a group identity tied to Judaism, potentially indicating antisemitic sentiments. Additionally, referring to settlers in a derogatory manner aligns with harmful stereotypes about Jewish people, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism. The mention of leaving the Labour Party due to Israel reflects criticism that could be seen as targeting Jewish identity, thus crossing into antisemitic territory.",Yes,"The tweet replaces references to ""Jews"" with ""Zionists,"" implying that all Jews are collectively connected to and responsible for Israel's actions. This aligns with JDA guidelines 7 and 9, which consider holding Jews accountable for Israel's conduct or assuming loyalty to Israel over one's own country as antisemitic.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, specifically the example where Jewish citizens are accused of being more loyal to Israel or Jewish interests over their own nation's interests. The use of the term ""trope"" implies a stereotype, which can contribute to antisemitic narratives. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet assumes that non-Israeli Jews, like Lipman, owe more allegiance to another nation (Israel) than their country of residence. This assumption aligns with JDA guideline 9, which identifies as antisemitic the belief that Jews are necessarily more loyal to Israel than to their own countries.

This comparison can reinforce negative stereotypes and be seen as demoralizing or dehumanizing towards either group, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by diminishing other groups' struggles or exploiting victimhood for rhetorical gain.",Yes,"The tweet in question compares the suffering of Jews to that of black people. While it may seem neutral on its surface, it can be interpreted as implying that Jewish suffering is uniquely significant or more deserving of attention than that of others. This comparison risks perpetuating negative stereotypes about Jews, particularly if it suggests a hierarchy of suffering where Jews are positioned above others. By linking the mention of Jewish suffering with such comparisons, the tweet could inadvertently reinforce antisemitic narratives that reduce complex historical and social issues to simplistic generalizations.
