This use of harmful stereotypes and mendacious allegations targets Jews and serves to spread hate, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""concentration camps"" to refer to ICE facilities, which directly equates U.S. government agencies with Nazi concentration camps used during the Holocaust. This comparison is a form of denying or minimizing the Holocaust, as per guideline 5 of the JDA, and it perpetuates harmful antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jews to such atrocities. Therefore, this tweet is deemed antisemitic."

According to the IHRA definition, this constitutes an antisemitic act as it involves targeting Jewish sites. While the tweet's full context is unclear, the mention of such vandalism aligns with antisemitic behavior by negatively impacting Jewish communities. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism based on the provided examples and legal definitions.",Yes,"The tweet includes two elements that align with antisemitic behavior. First, it explicitly mentions vandalizing Jewish houses of worship, a direct act of hostility against Jews as outlined in guideline 3. Second, the reference to ""reminding Jews why I..."" suggests an association with harm or evil, which ties into the broader antisemitic stereotype of Jews being linked to negative forces (guideline 2 and 4). These elements collectively indicate antisemitism under the JDA definition."

This aligns with IHRA's definition by accusing Jews as a people of responsibility for actions or facing mistreatment, thus constituting antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references a statement that Jews have been subjected to different, humiliating, and exclusionary behavior. According to the JDA guidelines, particularly points 2 and 3, this generalization about Jews as a group aligns with classic antisemitic tropes, which link Jews with negative experiences. Therefore, it meets the criteria for antisemitism by making a sweeping negative generalization about Jewish people."

It also refers to ""a black unar,"" but without clear context or intent to harm Jewish individuals. The content accurately reports on the event and does not use mendacious allegations, dehumanizing statements, or harmful stereotypes about Jews as per IHRA's definition. Therefore, it is not deemed antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet juxtaposes the arrest of a white supremacist who murdered 11 Jews with an unspecified action involving a Black individual. This creates a comparison that, when viewed through the lens of antisemitic coded language, suggests unequal treatment based on race. By contrasting these two situations, the tweet may imply racial bias or negative stereotypes that align with antisemitic tropes, thus adhering to the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves hateful rhetoric targeting Jews. Advocating violence, such as gassing, is a severe manifestation of antisemitic hatred and meets the criteria outlined in the IHRA framework. The reference to historical atrocities like the Holocaust further underscores the harm intended by this statement. Therefore, the tweet crosses the threshold into antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet advocates for gassing Jews, which directly promotes violence against Jewish people. According to the JDA, this constitutes antisemitism because it involves hostility towards Jews as a group. The guideline highlights that such acts of violence are examples of antisemitic deeds (see point 3). Therefore, the tweet aligns with the definition and guidelines provided by the JDA, making it antisemitic."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it uses language that dehumanizes and singles out Jewish people, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes about their role in events. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet refers to ""the King of the Jews,"" which invokes antisemitic tropes by implying a Jewish individual with undue influence or power. This aligns with JDA guidelines 2 and 3, as it associates Jews with conspiratorial ideas about hidden control. While context may vary, the phrase suggests a negative stereotyping of Jews, fitting the definition of antisemitism."

This framing promotes negative stereotypes about Jewish identity and societal relations, aligning with antisemitic notions that view Jews as needing separateness for survival, which can be seen as harmful and stereotypical.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as it perpetuates a harmful stereotype suggesting that Jewish survival depends on anti-Semitic attitudes. This aligns with guidelines 2, 5, and point 7 of the JDA, which highlight the dangerous implications of linking Jews to evil forces and minimizing historical atrocities."

Like I mean holy shit, this� https://t.co/VZ4VXyCxBF",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews are frequently targeted and questions why this happens. While it doesn't explicitly mention well-known antisemitic tropes, the implication of a collective negative perception aligns with antisemitic ideals. It could perpetuate harmful stereotypes by generalizing criticism towards Jews, thus fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet expresses frustration about why people target Jews collectively. While it doesn't explicitly use stereotypes, it generalizes criticism against Jews, aligning with antisemitic narratives of collective blame and potential coded language. This aligns with JDA guidelines that consider such generalized criticism as antisemitic, as it can perpetuate negative stereotypes or imply unfair targeting."

That�s happening on your watch, you worthless piece of garbage. https://t.co/zzqqooEssF",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language towards Rudy Giuliani, who is referred to as a ""worthless piece of garbage."" It implies that under his watch, Jews were unsafe in NYC, which aligns with antisemitic tropes that blame Jewish individuals for negative situations. This criticism targets Giuliani as a Jew, fitting into the IHRA definition by dehumanizing and blaming him for perceived failures related to Jews, thus constituting antisemitism.",No,The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics as defined by the JDA. It criticizes individuals based on their perceived failures in maintaining public safety rather than targeting Jewish identity or using anti-Semitic tropes or language.

If the comments are taken out of context and used in a harmful or stereotypical manner, particularly targeting Jewish individuals or collectively blaming them for issues, it could be considered antisemitic. Conversely, if the statements are critical of Israel without attacking Jewish people, they may not meet the criteria. Without knowing the exact content, the decision cannot be definitively made.",No,"The tweet does not contain any antisemitic content. It references Alan Dershowitz speaking about Jews but does not include negative stereotypes, hostility, or discrimination. Therefore, it adheres to the JDA guidelines and is not considered antisemitic."

According to IHRA, this aligns with antisemitic rhetoric that targets Jewish people as collectively responsible for harm against others, fitting into the category of dehumanizing or stereotyping Jews.",Yes,"The tweet equates the killing of Muslims in different regions by ISIS, Jews in Palestine, and Buddhists in Burma. It collectively implicates Jews in Palestine, suggesting they are responsible for such violence without providing context or differentiation from other groups like ISIS or Buddhists. This aligns with antisemitic tropes that link Jews to evil forces or conspiracies, as outlined in the JDA guidelines. Specifically, it fits point 7, which states that holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct is antisemitic. The tweet thus reinforces negative stereotypes and meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

I� https://t.co/hccG2g7Wfb",No,"The tweet discusses the historical mistreatment of Jews by Democrats and the consistent support American Jews show for the Democratic party. While it highlights negative experiences and paradoxes in Jewish political loyalty, it does not demonize or stereotype Jews nor express hatred towards them. The critique is directed at a political party's behavior rather than targeting Jews as a people, thus avoiding the antisemitic criteria outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not specifically target Jews as a group but rather discusses the treatment of Jews by Democrats and their political choices. It criticizes the party's actions without implying any inherent negative stereotypes or collective responsibility on the part of Jews, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA guidelines."

It provides neutral information about her identity without any hateful or stereotypical content, thus does not align with antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet does not contain any discriminatory language, negative stereotypes, or coded antisemitic implications about the Jewish woman mentioned. It simply describes her political stance and attire without any harmful context. While ""Jews For..."" could potentially imply something negative depending on its context, the information provided does not suggest such intent.

These phrases have historical antisemitic connotations, such as implying superiority or reinforcing stereotypes about Jews as chosen people or controllers. While not all uses of these terms are antisemitic, in this context they potentially dehumanize or stereotype Jews, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. Additionally, the use of a derogatory term like ""d"" further supports the antisemitic nature of the statement.",Yes,"The tweet contains references that connect Donald Trump to Jewish religious concepts like being ""the chosen one"" and ""King of Israel."" While not explicitly antisemitic in content, it appropriates these symbols, which can be interpreted as diminishing Jewish identity or perpetuating stereotypes. This alignment with Jewish historical terms may offend some and aligns with antisemitic tropes about Jewish influence and leadership, making the tweet inappropriate and offensive."

It uses language that dehumanizes and implies a harmful conspiracy theory about Jewish people, aligning with IHRA's definitions of antisemitism through the use of mendacious allegations and stereotyping.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Representative Ilhan Omar holds a conspiratorial view linking Jews to the September 11 attacks. This aligns with antisemitic tropes outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), specifically guideline 2, which highlights the association of Jews with evil forces or conspiracies. By referencing ""conspiratorial Jew-hatred"" and implying a connection between Jews and such a traumatic event, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes that Jews are responsible for significant tragic events, thus constituting antisemitism."

This involves preventing Jewish individuals from religious activities and using violence, aligning with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish identity through actions meant to hinder their activities.",No,"The tweet describes a situation where rioters were attempting to prevent Jews from touring a holy site and mentions that they threw rocks and chairs at policemen. While antisemitism can involve opposition to Jewish presence or activities, the tweet does not explicitly target Jews as a group or use antisemitic stereotypes or language. It appears to be a neutral description of a conflict between rioters and law enforcement. The JDA guidelines specify that antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as Jews, and this tweet does not seem to meet that criteria. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

Historica� https://t.co/L2xXR67pzZ",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language that reflects antisemitic sentiments by targeting Jewish individuals as collectively responsible for acquiring land, which aligns with stereotypes about Jewish control and expansionism. The mention of ""foreign Jews"" and the implication that they received a gift of Palestinian land from someone's family suggests a negative perception of Jews as outsiders taking what doesn't belong to them. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in its accusations against Jewish communities for real or imagined wrongdoing. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet references a scenario where ""foreign Jews"" receive Palestine as a gift from the speaker's family. This implies that Jewish individuals are taking land that originally belonged to others, which aligns with classical antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies and control over territories. By suggesting that foreign Jews have illegitimately gained influence or ownership, the tweet invokes negative stereotypes linked to antisemitism, as defined by the JDA. Specifically, it reflects a belief in Jewish collective power exerted over others' lands, which is a form of coded antisemitic language. Thus, this content meets the criteria outlined in the JDA guidelines for antisemitism."

While it's a political statement criticizing Israeli policy, it does not target Jewish people as a group or use antisemitic stereotypes. According to IHRA, criticism of Israel is not inherently antisemitic unless it involves harmful stereotypes or demonization. This tweet falls under protected free speech targeting government policies rather than Jews as individuals, so it's not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit traits of antisemitism as per the JDA. It involves Jewish individuals protesting against Israeli occupation policies, which aligns with permissible criticism of Israel as a state under guidelines 13 and 14. There's no indication of stereotyping Jews negatively or promoting classical antisemitic ideas about Jews being inherently evil or conspiratorial. Instead, it reflects political dissent focused on specific policies, which is protected under free speech rights."

This equates Jewishness with negative consequences and collective blame, aligning with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, which include blaming a group for societal issues and using religion to dehumanize. The targeting of Jews through such statements fits the definition as it reflects harmful stereotypes and dehumanizing language directed at Jewish individuals collectively.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""dammed Jews,"" which implies condemnation based on their religion, and references a religious text (Quran) to curse them. This aligns with JDA guidelines, specifically point 2, which identifies antisemitism through the linkage of Jews to evil forces. The use of verbal attacks against Jewish people as a group based on their faith constitutes discrimination and hostility, meeting the criteria for antisemitism."

This direct incitement to violence against a Jewish group clearly aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes expressions of hatred and violent rhetoric targeting Jewish individuals or communities. Regardless of the individual's other affiliations or context, advocating for the extermination of Jews is a manifestation of antisemitic ideology. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly calls for ""Exterminating"" Jews, which constitutes direct hostility against a group based on their Jewish identity. According to the JDA, this is a manifestation of antisemitism as it involves an incitement to violence or harm against Jews.

This targets Jews collectively, suggesting they are responsible for these negatives, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in blaming a Jewish collective for societal problems.",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit characteristics of antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It expresses concerns about a situation negatively impacting Jews and other groups without using antisemitic language, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories.

These actions are focused on addressing historical atrocities, not on targeting Jews. There is no use of antisemitic language or stereotypes.

According to JDA guidelines, this could fall under verbal antisemitism (point 3), as it involves words that demean or stereotype Jews.
