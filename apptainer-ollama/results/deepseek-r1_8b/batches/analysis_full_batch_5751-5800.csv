That's not in the Hebrew CHRISTIAN: no one knows what the original language means JEWS: Yes we do. We can read it. CHRISTIAN: It's lost forever,No,"The tweet presents a conversation between Christians and Jews discussing an Old Testament verse, with the Jews confidently stating their knowledge of Hebrew. While this could invoke a stereotype about Jewish linguistic expertise, there is no evidence of hatred, harmful accusations, or denial of historical facts typically associated with antisemitism as defined by IHRA. The interaction appears to be a lighthearted debate rather than an expression of antisemitic ideology.",No,"The tweet discusses a theological debate between Christians and Jews regarding the translation of an Old Testament verse. It does not contain any references to classical antisemitic stereotypes, such as financial manipulation or linking Jews to evil forces. Instead, it focuses on linguistic ownership and accuracy in interpretation. There is no dehumanizing language or implicit negative stereotyping directed at Jews as a group. Thus, this exchange does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It suggests that such attire leads to criticism and implies that the individuals are at fault for it, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by linking Jewish identity to negative actions or reactions. This statement uses stereotypes about Jewish appearance and behavior, reinforcing harmful notions that can contribute to antisemitic attitudes.",Yes,"The tweet in question targets Hasidic Jews by implying their provocative clothing leads to unwanted situations. This reduces the group to a stereotype based on appearance, which aligns with guidelines against making sweeping negative generalizations about a population. By linking Jewish identity to attire and inviting criticism or harm, the tweet contributes to antisemitic sentiment. Thus, it is considered antisemitic under the JDA's definition."

Perhaps both.",Yes,"The tweet in question targets the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community by assuming their absence from Twitter and questions the mayor's intent as rooted in prejudice or ignorance. This assumes a negative stereotype of Jews and collectively blames them for the mayor's actions, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through blaming a Jewish group without justification. It thus qualifies as antisemitic due to its stereotyping and collective blame, fitting into the IHRA criteria.",Yes,"The tweet targets Jewish communities, specifically ultra Orthodox Jews, by questioning the mayor's intent and implying prejudice. It uses sweeping generalizations about their absence from Twitter and suggests underlying biases or ignorance towards them.

It employs strong terms like ""sinister TRAITORS,"" which could imply disloyalty tied to Jewish identity. This targets the Labour Party, possibly linking them with anti-Semitic stereotypes and blaming societal issues on Jews or their perceived influence, thereby aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses sweeping negative generalizations about Labour, accusing them of institutional racism against specific ethnic groups, including Jews and whites. This aligns with JDA guideline A1, which views such generalizations as racist. Additionally, targeting these groups in this manner falls under antisemitism as defined by the JDA. The tweet's language and content suggest a broader pattern of negative stereotyping that fits the criteria for antisemitism."

This implies a stereotype where Jewishness is used to influence others, aligning withIHRA's examples of antisemitism, such as blaming Jews for conspiracies or manipulating non-Jews through identity.",Yes,"The tweet in question invokes negative stereotypes by suggesting that Jewishness can coerce others into specific beliefs through marriage and half-Jewish children. This implies a form of persuasive power tied to Jewish identity, aligning with JDA guidelines that treat such generalizations as antisemitic. It also reflects the idea of Jews exerting influence over non-Jews, which is a classical antisemitic trope. The mention of ""half-Jewish children"" further perpetuates stereotypes about mixed heritage, contributing to the overall antisemitic undertone. Thus, this tweet meets several criteria under the JDA, including negative stereotyping and implying Jewish influence in personal relationships, making it an example of antisemitism."

This analogy equates the Indian government (specifically the BJP) to Nazi actions, which is a harmful and dehumanizing comparison. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes making mendacious or stereotypical accusations about Jews or Jewish communities. By associating current political issues with the atrocities committed by Nazis against Jews, the tweet spreads antisemitic rhetoric that targets not only the policies but also the Indian government as a collectivity. Such comparisons can trivialize the Holocaust and incite hatred by conflating contemporary events with historical atrocities, thereby aligning with antisemitic behavior as defined.",Yes,"The tweet compares India's citizenship policies to the actions of Nazi Germany, referencing Hitler's detention centers and their impact on Jews. This analogy draws a direct historical comparison that associates the Indian government's policies with the atrocities committed against Jews during the Holocaust. While not explicitly targeting Jews, the use of such language can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation by equating contemporary political issues with genocidal events, thus aligning with antisemitic tendencies as defined by the JDA."

This indicates an antisemitic perception, as it reflects dislike for Jews specifically and in conjunction with others. Additionally, the mention of the US being ""invaded"" could imply a stereotype about Jewish influence, further supporting the presence of antisemitic elements. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly mentions ""intolerance towards Jews & Muslims,"" which directly targets these groups. It uses terms like ""Muslim ban"" and ""expanded Muslim ban,"" indicating discrimination against Muslims, while also referencing Jews.

This analogy involves using imagery and historical context strongly associated with antisemitism to describe an attack on another group. By invoking Kristallnacht, the tweet risks trivializing the Holocaust while potentially dehumanizing or stereotyping towards another community. According to IHRA's definition, this type of comparison, which employs Nazi-related symbols and draws parallels to Jewish suffering, aligns with behaviors considered antisemitic, as it can contribute to the perception of Jews as a collective facing similar persecution, thus reinforcing harmful stereotypes.",No,"The tweet does not target Jews or involve any form of discrimination against them. Dr. Priya Gopal compares the attack on Muslims in New Delhi to Kristallnacht, which is a historical reference to an anti-Semitic event. However, her comparison is used to highlight violence against another group and does not reflect antisemitism as defined by the JDA, which specifically involves targeting Jews or Jewish institutions. Thus, the tweet is not considered antisemitic under the given guidelines."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes making stereotypical or dehumanizing allegations about Jews collectively. By suggesting that being Jewish leads to death or suffering, it reinforces harmful stereotypes and can incite hatred towards Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet ""Christians and Jews have died, and atheists have lived. Explain that."" appears to equate the deaths of Christians and Jews with the survival of atheists, which could imply a negative stereotype about Jews dying while others thrive. This aligns with classical antisemitic themes of Jews facing elimination or hardship. Although it's a comparison rather than explicit hate speech, it reinforces harmful stereotypes by linking Jews collectively to negative outcomes, thus falling under antisemitic discrimination as per the JDA guidelines."

This aligns with IHRA examples of antisemitism through dehumanizing associations and stereotyping of Jews.",Yes,"The tweet associates a Jewish group (""Jews for Jesus Guy"") with promoting Trump over medical expertise. This links the individual's Jewish identity to a specific political stance, treating the Jewish identity as inherently supportive of Trump. By connecting the Jewish group's identity to this recommendation, it suggests that Jews are collectively responsible for supporting Trump, which aligns with antisemitic tropes of Jews having undue influence or promoting harmful agendas. This is an example of indirect antisemitism where a stereotype about Jewish behavior is applied to promote a political figure, in line with the JDA's guidelines on coded speech and collective responsibility."

According to the JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as a group.

It generalizes negatively about non-Jews as inherently jealous and associates antisemitism with such emotions, reinforcing stereotypes of Jewish victimhood and non-Jewish enmity.
