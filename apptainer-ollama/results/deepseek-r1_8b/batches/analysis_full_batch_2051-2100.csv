This is presented to critique the partition decision. While not explicitly antisemitic, it reinforces stereotypes by implying Jewish exploitation or unfair advantage.

Auschwitz is a reference to concentration camps where the Holocaust occurred, invoking antisemitic historical trauma.

This language targets both the state of Israel and Jewish people collectively. According to IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves hostile attitudes or behaviors towards Jewish individuals or communities, including blaming them for issues or using pejorative language. The tweet's mention of hating both Israel (a Jewish collectivity) and Jews directly reflects anti-Semitic tropes by associating Jewish people with negative actions. Thus, this expression aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet expresses a dislike for Amnesty International that is framed around hating both Israel and Jews. The use of the word ""hate"" specifically towards both groups suggests a form of hostility directed at Jewish people, not just the state. This aligns with antisemitic tropes where Jews are stereotyped as part of a conspiratorial force or negatively associated with evil. By targeting both Israel and Jews, the tweet collectively demonizes Jewish identity, which falls under the definition of antisemitism as discrimination or hostility against Jews. The strong language used reinforces a hostile environment towards the Jewish community, making this expression fit within the parameters of antisemitic speech according to the JDA guidelines."

This statement promotes a form of separatism that can be seen as discriminatory towards non-Jewish populations and inconsistent with equal rights principles.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews must have an ethno state based on their identity, which aligns with antisemitic principles by requiring Jews to form a separate political entity, thus enforcing collective responsibilities and denying others' rights.
