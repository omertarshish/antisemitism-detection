I'm confused (inferiority) We're looked at as 2nd class citizens they have destroyed our history and our unemployment doubles the national average https://t.co/P4Skwga7y8,Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It references stereotypical views of Jewish inferiority, accuses Jews of facing discrimination and being treated as second-class citizens, and blames them for societal issues like unemployment and historical destruction. These points correspond to antisemitic tropes such as blaming Jews collectively for societal ills and denying equal opportunities to Jews, which are clearly defined as antisemitic by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It mentions stereotypical views of Jewish inferiority, treats Jews as second-class citizens, and suggests economic harm to the Jewish community. These points fit into the antisemitic framework outlined in the guidelines, specifically targeting Jews based on their identity."

It is explained as fight against transnational criminal gangs https://t.co/re7foVcgHi,Yes,"The tweet describes a situation where the National Police in Kolomiya is requesting detailed personal information about Jews and Jewish students from the Jewish community. This appears to be a targeted request for information specifically related to Jewish identity, which could violate principles of privacy and non-discrimination. Such actions may align with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, particularly if they involve stereotyping or disproportionately targeting Jewish individuals without a valid, non-discriminatory rationale. The justification provided by the police for this request (combating transnational criminal gangs) does not seem to necessitate such detailed information about Jewish citizens, which raises concerns of differential treatment based on religious or ethnic identity.",Yes,"The tweet in question involves the demand by Ukrainian authorities for the Jewish community of Kolomiya to provide lists of individuals' addresses and phone numbers, including Jewish students. This targeted request singles out Jews based on their ethnicity, which constitutes discrimination against them as a group. It aligns with antisemitic behavior by singling out Jewish individuals, potentially stirring fear or reinforcing negative stereotypes. While the justification is framed as combating crime, the specific targeting of Jewish people without broader context suggests an inappropriate focus on a particular ethnic group, consistent with elements of antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

Where satans satans seat is,Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language such as calling Jews ""dweeb jews"" and associates them with ""satan dwellers,"" which are classic antisemitic tropes. It also suggests that Jews are a problem and implies a negative stereotype, aligning with the IHRA definition of antisemitism through verbal attacks and harmful associations.",Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the JDA definition of antisemitism. It derogatorily refers to Jews as ""dweeb jews"" and associates them with satan dwellers, which stereotypically links Jews to evil forces ( guideline A2 ). This Essentialization and negative generalization about Jews constitutes discrimination against Jews as Jews ( guideline A1 ). The reference to satan dwellers also falls under the category of classical antisemitic imagery applied to Jews, even without direct mention of Israel. Thus, the tweet violates the JDA guidelines by promoting antisemitic content."

This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish control over land, as per IHRA's definition, which includes blaming Jews collectively for territorial issues and using religious texts to justify such claims. While not explicitly hateful, the context stereotypically implicates Jews in controlling or having a superior claim to land, fitting into antisemitic tropes.",Yes,"The tweet references Quranic statements about Palestine belonging to Jews and criticizes other groups as encroachers. According to the JDA, denying the right of Jews to exist in Israel is antisemitic (guideline 10). By citing religious text to assert Jewish ownership of Palestinian land, the tweet could invoke classical antisemitic tropes that stereotyped Jews as having false or excessive claims to territory. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism targeting Jews because of their identity, thus meeting the criteria for being antisemitic."

Anyway what does economic status have to do with racism?,Yes,"The tweet references stereotypes about Jewish wealth and connects economic status to potential racism, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. It uses economic success as a means to imply negative stereotypes or accusations against the Jewish community, fitting the criteria of stereotyping and blaming a group for societal issues.",Yes,"The tweet references statistical data about Jewish income but introduces it to question why Jews are perceived as rich, invoking a stereotype tied to classic antisemitic tropes.

This narrative targets Jewish individuals as part of a future conflict, which aligns with antisemitic tropes that dehumanize Jews by framing them as collective enemies in apocalyptic scenarios. Additionally, the statement equates this belief to a common Christian practice (Easter) to normalize it, suggesting Muslim leaders are actively pursuing this end, thereby promoting a harmful stereotype of Jews as threats. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes dehumanizing or harmful depictions of Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet describes a Muslim end-time prophecy where Muslims fight Jews and disbelievers. This aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that depict Jews as enemies involved in conflicts, reinforcing hostility against them.

This act mocks and equates the governor's actions with those of the Nazis, using Nazi-related rhetoric against a Jewish individual. According to IHRA's definition, this constitutes antisemitism by targeting Jews with language that trivializes the Holocaust and links them to atrocities committed by the Nazis. Additionally, it collectively accuses the governor, a Jewish individual, of being part of a negative stereotype or conspiracy, which aligns with antisemitic examples provided by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet references the phrase ""work makes free,"" which was used at Auschwitz, directed at Illinois' Jewish Governor JB Pritzker. This directly links Jewish identity with a reference to the Holocaust, targeting him specifically as a Jew. According to the JDA, this discriminates against Jews as Jews, making it antisemitic. The use of a traumatic historical reference to demean and target a Jewish individual falls under direct antisemitism, as per the guidelines provided."

Stop it. https://t.co/xhw1klQpQR",Yes,"The tweet compares Jews fleeing Nazi-occupied countries to modern-day individuals relocating for personal reasons. While not explicitly denying the Holocaust or promoting stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies, this comparison trivializes the unique and horrific historical context of Jewish suffering during WWII. By equating such a dire situation with individual migration decisions, the tweet risks dehumanizing Jewish history and reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews, thus aligning with the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it involves harmful generalizations and inappropriate analogies.",Yes,"The tweet equates Jews fleeing Nazi-occupied countries with individuals moving from France to Britain for personal reasons. According to the JDA, this comparison trivializes the historical persecution of Jews during the Holocaust and perpetuates negative stereotypes by reducing their suffering to a personal choice.

It falsely accuses Jews of exploiting capitalism and involves demeaning acts targeted at Jewish individuals, fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior as outlined in IHRA's examples.",Yes,"The tweet describes an incident where Jews were subjected to racial humiliation by the Nazis in 1938. This act of degradation and enforced labor is based on their Jewish identity, constituting discrimination and hostility against them as Jews.

It dismisses support for the ANC based on this association and uses derogatory terms towards white people, which can incite hatred and aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweetantisemitically suggests that white Jews had undue influence over the ANC by drafting the Freedom Charter. This aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes linking Jews to negative political influence. The phrase ""Kudala basiphatha abelungu"" indicates distrust of white people, further reinforcing antisemitic undertones. The implication that Jewish involvement in the ANC's history justifies criticism and refusal to support the ANC reflects coded antisemitic speech that targets Jews for their identity, thus constituting antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

By equating a non-Jewish individual to a regime known for genocide, it associates criticism of others with antisemitic tropes and the suffering of Jews, thus invoking harmful stereotypes and diminishing the gravity of historical atrocities. This use of the Holocaust in a comparative context aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by targeting Jewish-related history to demean individuals, crossing into dehumanizing language.",Yes,"The tweet compares a person to someone responsible for the mass murder of Jews, referencing the Holocaust.

The tweet addresses two individuals by accusing them of being antisemitic and refuses to recognize them as allies due to their beliefs.

It targets specific groups like Israelis and Ultra-Orthodox Jews, associates antisemitism with BLM supporters, and uses derogatory terms, all of which align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses sweeping negative generalizations and conspiracy theories linking Jewish support for BLM with anti-Semitic actions. It associates Jews collectively with attacks on Israelis and Jewish institutions, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes of Jew conspiracies and evil linkages (Guidelines A2 and A4).

It also mentions the persistence of slavery in certain regions, which could be interpreted as an accusation against Jewish people collectively, aligning with IHRA's example of blaming a group for real or imagined wrongdoing.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves targeting Jewish individuals or their institutions, often with intent to harm or discriminate. If the act of forcing someone to wear a Jewish symbol is done coercively and singles out Jewish identity, it can be seen as targeting Jewish collectivities, falling under antisemitic discrimination. This aligns with IHRA's criteria, where such actions are considered antisemitic if they involve denying rights to self-determination or applying double standards based on Jewish identity. Therefore, the tweet, in its current context, indicates an antisemitic act.",Yes,"The tweet states, ""Fact: it is nothing like forcing Jews to wear a Star of David."" This statement implies that Jews are being coerced to display the Star of David, a symbol closely associated with Jewish identity and the state of Israel. According to the JDA guidelines, particularly points 10 and 7, this can be seen as an attempt to deny Jews their right to exist as Jews or force them into a specific identity, which aligns with antisemitic principles. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic as it discriminates against Jews based on their Jewish identity by suggesting forced association with a symbol."
