It references a political figure comparing himself to a fictional character from ""The Godfather,"" which is unrelated to Jewish people or antisemitic tropes. There's no indication of blaming Jews for conspiracies, denying the Holocaust, or applying stereotypes associated with anti-Semitism. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under IHRA's guidelines.",No,"The tweet in question compares Andrew Cuomo to Sonny Corleone, a fictional character from ""The Godfather."" While this comparison might draw on stereotypes of powerful leaders, there is no direct link or context that associates Jews with evil or harmful stereotypes. The content does not mention Jews or Jewish institutions and instead focuses on political leadership. Therefore, based on the JDA guidelines, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as it does not involve discrimination against Jews or relate to classical antisemitic tropes."

It discusses a situation where anti-racists have taken action against an individual for their views, which is not directed at Jewish identity but rather at the individual's speech. There is no indication of hatred towards Jews or use of antisemitic stereotypes, making it fall outside the scope of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet describes an instance where anti-racists are targeting a Jewish individual solely for their religious identity, which constitutes discrimination against Jews as Jews. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes hostility towards Jews based on their religion. The action involves coordinated reporting, a form of harassment directed at someone's Jewish identity, fitting the criteria outlined in guidelines 3 and 5. Therefore, the tweet is deemed antisemitic."

Ranting about the Jews reveals you as a man who had not profited from either his service or travel. Sad.,Yes,"The tweet includes verbal criticism targeting Jews by implying a fixation on them as a group. It aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through negative stereotypes and collective blame, even without direct threats. This meets the criteria for antisemitic expression in public discourse.",No,"The tweet criticizes Donald Trump for ranting about Jews but does not explicitly target Jewish people as a group or use negative stereotypes. It is a general criticism of his behavior, not an attack on Jews. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by the JDA."

The Jehovah Witnesses? Atheists? How about Mar a Lagoists?,Yes,"The tweet draws a comparison between Hinduism and Catholicism, followed by a list of various groups, including Jews. It uses the phrase ""they will come for the Jews,"" which reinforces historical antisemitic tropes about Jewish persecution. This language implies fear or concern about targeting, aligning with the IHRA definition's examples of demagogic accusations that demean or threaten Jewish communities. The inclusion of multiple groups suggests a pattern of collective threat, contributing to an antisemitic climate by implying vulnerability and potential harm, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet compares Hinduism to Catholicism and then lists various groups, including Jews, suggesting they might be targeted next. This evokes a fear of persecution and implies a hidden agenda against these groups, aligning with antisemitic tropes that link Jews to conspiracy or control. It uses coded language to stigmatize collectively, consistent with JDA guidelines on indirect antisemitism."

This accusation targets Jews as a collective, blaming them for societal issues, thus fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question retweets a statement implying that Jews are controlling space to start wildfires in California. According to the JDA, this type of assertion is antisemitic because it stereotypes Jews as having malevolent control over natural disasters and attributes harmful events to them. Such statements reflect the harmful stereotype that Jews possess secret power or influence, which aligns with classic antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA guidelines. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it targets Jewish individuals or groups by association, fostering negative stereotypes and collectively blaming non-Jewish entities for harm against Jews. The statement oversimplifies causes and may perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jewish experiences, fitting the criteria for antisemitic rhetoric.",No,"The tweet does not directly link Jews to COVID-19 or Republicans in an antisemitic manner. It expresses concern about threats but doesn't target Jews based on their Jewish identity, avoiding any racialization or conspiracy theories.

It consists of a clarification referencing Kristallnacht, a historical event, without expressing any hatred towards Jews or using the comparison to spread antisemitic stereotypes. The context is factual and educational rather than hateful or discriminatory.",No,"The tweet does not constitute antisemitism as defined by the JDA. Ben Shapiro is merely making a historical comparison and clarifying that Wednesday (November 9th) is not comparable to Kristallnacht, which is an event associated with antisemitism but is being discussed in a factual context without promoting hatred or discrimination against Jews. The comparison does not involve any elements of essentialization, generalized negativity about Jews, or the promotion of antisemitic stereotypes. Shapiro's statement is a matter of free speech and historical discussion, rather than an expression of antisemitic ideology."

This aligns with IHRA examples of blaming Jews for events and using negative stereotypes, thus qualifying as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references a statement that links Hitler's actions against Jews to his obsession with cleanliness, implying an association of Jewish people with negative or harmful stereotypes. This aligns with antisemitic beliefs, as outlined in the JDA guidelines, which identify such associations and stereotyping as forms of prejudice against Jews. The mention of ""othered"" community indicates a sense of exclusion, further supporting the presence of antisemitic undertones. Additionally, while not explicitly denying the Holocaust, the statement trivializes and justifies Hitler's actions, potentially downplaying its severity, which is also considered antisemitic. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

While the content addresses racial issues, IHRA's definition of antisemitism focuses on Jewish or linked communities. Since the tweet doesn't involve Jews or antisemitic tropes about them, it doesn't qualify as antisemitic under IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet discusses a government official's allegedly harmful statements regarding white and Black people, which are race-related but do not specifically target Jews or Jewish institutions. According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as Jews, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the tweet is not considered antisemitic."

Anyone else?,No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria set by the IHRA definition of antisemitism. While it mentions both Asians and Jews as having issues, it does not target Jewish individuals or institutions with hate or blame. Instead, it appears to be a general observation about problematic groups without promoting antisemitic ideas or incitement. Therefore, based on the provided analysis, the tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly target Jewish people with discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence. It simply mentions both Asians and Jews in a general context without assigning any negative attributes or stereotypes to Jewish individuals. While the mention of both groups together could potentially imply broader issues of discrimination, it does not specifically reflect the antisemitic criteria outlined by the JDA, which focuses on targeting Jewish people based on their ethnicity or religion with negative intent. Therefore, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines."

It manipulates historical atrocities to dehumanize Jews and reinforces harmful stereotypes, thus falling under antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet in question asks others to name a bad thing Jews did that justifies Hitler's killing of millions. This request frames Jews as collectively responsible for events where they were victimized, reinforcing antisemitic narratives. According to the JDA guidelines, this aligns with classic antisemitism by linking Jewish people to negative outcomes, thus dehumanizing them and promoting harmful stereotypes. Therefore, it is considered antisemitic."

They've also voiced support for white nationalism.,Yes,"The tweet describes RICI, a right-wing organization comprised of some Jews and Evangelical Christians, which targets Jewish entities for criticism regarding their support for Israel and harasses their members. Additionally, RICI supports white nationalism. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves targeting Jewish individuals or institutions with harmful accusations or actions based on Jewish identity. By accusing synagogues and Jewish entities of insufficiency and harassing their members, RICI's actions align with antisemitic behavior as they collectively target Jews for alleged wrongdoing. Furthermore, RICI's support for white nationalism, often linked to antisemitic ideologies, reinforces the antisemitic nature of these actions. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet associates RICI, a group with Jewish members, with supporting white nationalism, which is inherently racist. This association ties Jewish identity to a broader racist ideology, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes that link Jews with negative forces. While the tweet describes RICI's actions and beliefs accurately, the connection to white nationalism crosses into antisemitic territory by implying a harmful stereotype about Jewish loyalty and conspiracies. Thus, under the JDA guidelines, this content is considered antisemitic."

This aligns with antisemitic traits such as dehumanizing Jewish individuals, which falls under the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language (""fucking foolish"") targeting Jewish people, which constitutes discrimination against Jews as Jews. It also associates Jewish identity with something disliked (Purim), potentially contributing to negative stereotypes and hostility towards Jews, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

By referencing mass murders of Jews, LGBTQ individuals, and Gypsies, the tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes and associations linked to antisemitic narratives. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming specific groups for wrongdoing or conflating non-Jewish entities with those responsible for Jewish atrocities.",Yes,"The tweet references Henry Ford being compared to individuals who committed atrocities against Jews and other groups, specifically mentioning ""mass murdered Jews."" This directly ties into antisemitic tropes, particularly Holocaust denial or associating Jews with mass violence. According to JDA guidelines B5 and A4, such references can be considered antisemitic as they involve denials or associations that reflect discrimination against Jews."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes making negative stereotypes or accusing Jews of conspiring to harm others. The phrase is associated with Jewish identity in a way that might infer control or manipulation, fitting into the category of demonizing or applying negative stereotypes about Jews. Thus, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references a biblical verse and connects it to Jews and Israel. While the verse itself is a theological statement, interpreting it in a way that implies Jewish superiority or special rights can be seen as discriminatory, fitting the definition of antisemitism under the JDA guidelines. This interpretation links Jews to a sense of exclusivity, which aligns with classical antisemitic notions of Jewish privilege, thus making the tweet potentially antisemitic."

It employs conspiracy theories, such as implying a staged mass murder and using lasers to start fires, which are classic antisemitic tropes. Additionally, it suggests Jews are responsible for harmful actions against non-Jews, aligning with the IHRA's examples of antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet references conspiracy theories that link Jewish people to causing harm through specific methods like using lasers to start fires.

It suggests that Jews are often unfairly blamed for their own persecution, which reflects a negative perception that could be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition. The statement implies that Jews are collectively aware of being unjustly blamed, reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish victimization and exploitation without considering individual contexts. This aligns with examples of antisemitism where Jews are falsely accused or stereotyped in harmful ways.",Yes,"The tweet references Jews being blamed for their own persecution and suggests that they know how to make others hate their existence.

This does not align with any of the antisemitic examples provided by IHRA, such as blaming Jews for societal issues or denying Jewish suffering. Instead, it counters harmful stereotypes and reaffirms that Jews are not responsible for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains a statement that reinforces a stereotype about Jewish people not causing antisemitism. This statement is problematic because it essentializes Jews by suggesting that their very nature precludes them from being responsible for antisemitism. Such generalizations are akin to classical antisemitic tropes, which link Jewish identity to inherent characteristics that justify discrimination or hostility. The phrase ""Jews don’t cause antisemitism"" can be seen as a coded way of asserting racial or ethnic superiority over Jews, contributing to the broader context of antisemitic thought. By making such a sweeping generalization about an entire population, it violates Guideline A1 of the JDA, which prohibits essentializing and making negative generalizations about a group. Furthermore, this statement aligns with the tenets of antisemitism that reduce complex social dynamics to harmful stereotypes about Jewish identity. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic as per the JDA guidelines."

This invokes antisemitic stereotypes and tropes that associate Jewish communities with systematic discrimination or oppression, thereby targeting them based on their Jewish identity. Specifically, it aligns with JDA guidelines B7 (collective responsibility for Israel's conduct) and B9 (assuming loyalty to Israel over one's own country), as well as B10 (denying the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish). The use of ""apartheid,"" a term historically associated with racial segregation, to describe a situation affecting Jews, reinforces antisemitic notions by singling out Jewish identity for negative consequences. Thus, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic under the JDA definition."
