It doesn’t dehumanize Jews or use stereotypes; instead, it's a political critique of another politician’s statement. While it addresses anti-Semitic claims, the tweet itself isn't antisemitic as per IHRA’s definition.",No,"The tweet does not contain any content that meets the definition of antisemitism as per the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It is a critique of Swalwell's statement about attacks on Jews being stoked by Donald Trump, which may be a contentious political opinion but does not itself promote or endorse antisemitic views. The JDA guidelines specify that antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, and this tweet does not align with such criteria."

By suggesting that the Nazis were ""fine"" as long as they were rounding up Jews, it minimizes the severity of the Holocaust and implies a form of justification or normalization of their actions. This aligns with antisemitic practices that deny the full extent of the Holocaust's horror and use Nazi-related rhetoric to target Jewish people or groups. The tweet thus reflects antisemitic undertones by downplaying historical atrocities and invoking harmful comparisons, fitting within the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references the Nazi treatment of Jews in ghettos while comparing it to an argument. According to JDA guidelines, this comparison can be seen as invoking classical antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jews with negative historical events associated with persecution. Although not explicitly denying the Holocaust, the reference to Nazi actions reinforces antisemitic associations, making the tweet antisemitic."

While historically accurate, the context in which it is presented can be interpreted as questioning or blaming Jewish people for these events. According to IHRA's definition, antisemitism includes denying the Holocaust or accusing Jews of inventing or exaggerating it. By invoking this number without the appropriate context, the tweet could imply a negative perception of Jews, thereby aligning with antisemitic tropes.",Yes,"The tweet references the Holocaust, a well-documented historical event. While stating facts about the Holocaust isn't inherently antisemitic, the tone and context matter. The phrasing implies criticism and hostility towards Jews by invoking the Holocaust in a scolding manner. Guideline 5 of JDA states that minimizing or denying the Holocaust is antisemitic. This tweet may be seen as an indirect denial or promotion of harmful stereotypes linked to antisemitism. Thus, it adheres to the definition provided by JDA."

It mentions another group (implied by ""a black unr"") but does not explicitly target Jews with hateful rhetoric, stereotypes, or false allegations. While it addresses race-related arrest decisions, the focus is on law enforcement actions rather than antisemitic content directed at Jewish individuals or their community. Thus, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet juxtaposes a heavily armed white supremacist (who targeted Jewish individuals) with an unarmed black person, creating a contrast that could imply harmful racialized associations. While not explicitly antisemitic, the comparison reinforces negative stereotypes by linking Jewish victims to another group in a way that could perpetuate harmful narratives, thus aligning with JDA guidelines on indirect or coded antisemitism."

It suggests that Jewish donations prioritize non-American interests, reflectingIHRA's examples of blaming Jews for societal issues through actions like financial contributions, thus fitting the definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet expresses a political opinion about donating to a party that doesn't align with the donor's interests. It does not target Jews as a group or use antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories, nor does it link Jewish identity to negativity in any form. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under the JDA definition."

It does not contain any language or implications that target Jews negatively, nor does it reflect antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories. Instead, it emphasizes positive interactions and unity, aligning with the principle of promoting understanding rather than spreading hate.",No,"The tweet promotes interfaith efforts and peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Jews, aiming to foster understanding rather than discriminate or hostility. It does not contain any elements that align with the definition of antisemitism provided by the JDA, such as negative generalizations or classical antisemitic stereotypes."

This aligns with IHRA's definition, as it reflects harmful perceptions and stereotypes about Jewish people, contributing to an antisemitic narrative.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic because it makes sweeping negative generalizations about Jewish members of Congress by implying they are not allowed to wear a kippah, while a ""Muslim hating Jew"" can wear a hijab. This comparison reinforces negative stereotypes linking Jews with hostility towards others and suggests that non-Jewish individuals are treated more favorably, which aligns with antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA guidelines."

It blurs criticism of political figures with dehumanizing language about Jews, falling into the category of antisemitic speech.",No,"The tweet discusses criticism of political figures for encouraging individuals who have attacked Jews. While it mentions attacks on Jews and critiques politicians' support for these individuals, the tweet does not explicitly employ classical antisemitic stereotypes, nor does it directly link Jewish identity to negative actions beyond the context of policy criticisms. Therefore, under the JDA guidelines, this does not constitute antisemitism as defined."

This implies a biased or selective response that could be interpreted as targeting Jews for their loyalty to Israel, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by reflecting a discriminatory attitude towards Jewish individuals and their community.",Yes,"The tweet implies a disparity in AOC's response to attacks on Jewish communities compared to hypothetical responses to attacks by white individuals. This suggests an underlying stereotype that Jewish suffering is less prioritized, aligning with JDA guidelines on coded antisemitic speech and selective attention to group suffering."

Fuck you commies have a mental problem.,Yes,"The tweet associates a company run by Jews with the ""alt right,"" using pejorative language like ""Fuck you commies"" to demean Jewish individuals. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes dehumanizing statements and stereotypes targeting Jewish people as a collective, blaming them for negative actions or associations.",Yes,"The tweet in question links a company run by Jews to the Alt-Right, a political movement often associated with conservatism. By implying that Jewish-run companies are associated with this movement, it reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews controlling or influencing specific groups. The use of derogatory language towards critics further targets individuals based on their opinions, which could be seen as discriminatory. This aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA, particularly points 2 and 7, which emphasize the linkage of Jews to negative forces and collective responsibility. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it stigmatizes Jews through harmful stereotypes and language."

This statement can be interpreted as implying that Finland was complicit in atrocities against Jews, which could be seen as targeting Jewish people collectively. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism often involves blaming Jewish people or groups for historical events, especially when such accusations are made with the intent to stigmatize or demonize them. By linking Finland's actions during WWII to the murder of Jews, the tweet aligns with examples of antisemitism that attribute collective guilt or responsibility to Jewish individuals based on historical events. Therefore, this tweet is considered antisemitic as it invokes historical stereotypes and blame against Jewish people.",No,"The tweet discusses Finland's historical role during WWII, specifically its contribution to Nazi atrocities, which is a factual statement about the country's past actions and does not target Jewish people. It focuses on historical events rather than expressing hostility towards Jews as a group or their identity. Therefore, under the JDA guidelines, this content does not qualify as antisemitic since it is not based on discrimination against Jews but rather on historical critique."

This act implies a negative association with Jewish individuals and history, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews for harm against their community or memory.",Yes,"The tweet references AOC's actions as desecrating the memory of the Holocaust, which can be interpreted as an attack on Jewish identity by linking her to Holocaust denial. According to JDA guidelines, such actions are antisemitic as they either directly or indirectly demean Jews by associating them with Holocaust trivialization, a form of denying the reality and significance of the Holocaust. This aligns with points 5 and others that condemn Holocaust denial and the stigmatization of Jewish identity. Therefore, the tweet is considered antisemitic."

While it asserts that only Jews can define antisemitism, this statement does not involve hatred towards Jews or any discriminatory actions against them. It simply expresses an opinion about who has authority over the definition of antisemitism. Therefore, under the provided framework, the tweet is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet asserts that ""only Jews get to define antisemitism,"" which aligns with the JDA's guidelines by making a sweeping negative generalization about non-Jews not having a role in defining antisemitism. This assertion reinforces a stereotype that Jewish authority is exclusive, potentially leading to discrimination against non-Jews. According to the JDA, such generalized statements can be considered antisemitic as they restrict the ability of others to contribute to the definition, thereby marginalizing non-Jewish voices and reinforcing negative stereotypes."

This comparison equates two different groups through historical antisemitic tropes, thereby aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as involving dehumanizing stereotypes and justifying attacks on Jewish or other groups by linking them to past hatred towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet draws an analogy between the Nazi's attack on Jews and an attack on Muslims, comparing the attacker's actions to those of a Nazi. This comparison potentially reinforces antisemitic stereotypes by linking two different groups (Jews and Muslims) through the context of being targeted by attackers. While it doesn't explicitly mention Jews, the reference to Nazis associates the act with a historical antisemitic event, thus aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as involving prejudice against Jews or Jewish institutions. The use of this comparison could be seen as an indirect form of coded speech that implies a harmful linkage, falling under guideline 4 and reinforcing the racialization of Jews, thereby qualifying the tweet as antisemitic."

If ""r�"" is a slang or reference targeting Jewish individuals, it could imply exclusion or antisemitic undertones. While the exact meaning isn't clear without more context, the mention of Jews suggests potential antisemitism based on IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet instructs others to ""leave us out of your r�,"" implying the exclusion of American Jews from a conversation based on their Jewish identity. This aligns with JDA guidelines that consider targeting Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as discriminatory, particularly when involving collective exclusion in political contexts. The statement suggests a desire to exclude American Jews, potentially stemming from stereotypes about their influence or involvement, thus fitting under antisemitic definitions."

Asking for a friend...,No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly contain any antisemitic content. While it references Rashida Tlaib and asks if something includes Jews, the lack of specific context makes it ambiguous. Antisemitism requires explicit expressions of hatred or negative stereotypes towards Jews, which are not present here. Without clear evidence of blaming Jews for wrongdoing or using harmful stereotypes, the tweet does not meet the criteria outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet asks whether something includes Jews, potentially implying Jewish targeting or influence. While not overtly antisemitic, it could be coded as such by suggesting Jewish involvement in a manner aligned with antisemitic tropes, thus conforming to the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It's disgusting ?? https://t.co/X9UTgeo8KS",Yes,"The tweet expresses a negative attitude towards Jews by questioning their sudden exclusion from community activities and using terms like ""hatred"" and ""disgusting."" This aligns with antisemitic sentiments that involve negative perceptions and emotional responses directed at Jews. While it doesn't explicitly mention conspiracy theories, the concern about Jewish integration and the negative tone suggest underlying prejudiced views consistent with antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet generalizes the concept of hatred towards Jewish individuals without specific justification. It suggests that there's an inherent dislike for Jews, which can be interpreted as discrimination or prejudice against them. While it doesn't use explicit antisemitic language, it implies a negative stereotype about Jewish people, falling under the category of broader discriminatory behavior as defined by the JDA."

It does not contain any negative stereotypes, coded language, or conspiracy theories about Jews as a group. Instead, it refers to a factual event involving violence against Jewish individuals without making generalizations or linking all Jews to such violence.

This falls under the IHRA definition's examples of accusing Jews collectively responsible for acts committed by individuals or groups, and it reflects a conspiracy-like narrative. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet attributes the Pittsburgh massacre to Jews, implying Jewish responsibility for the event. This aligns with JDA guidelines, specifically point 3, which outlines antisemitic actions such as blaming a group for negative events. By linking Jews to violence, it reinforces harmful stereotypes and falls under indirect antisemitic speech, thus qualifying as antisemitic according to the JDA."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes accusations targeting a specific group for wrongdoing, even if individuals are not directly involved. It also reflects a stereotype where Jews are collectively blamed, fitting the criterion of attributing negative actions to a Jewish collectivity.",Yes,"The tweet's content suggests that ""the jews"" are being blamed for actions by someone's grandparents, which aligns with antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA. Specifically, it reflects a negative generalization about Jews as a group, linking them to blame without sufficient justification, thereby conforming to points 2 and 3 of the guidelines. This places the tweet within the realm of antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It implies a connection to historical Jewish issues, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and blaming Jewish people for past atrocities.",Yes,"The tweet draws a comparison between a current situation and the 1930s Nazi Germany regime, referencing German Jews and their beliefs. This implies Holocaust reference or denial ( guideline 5 ), and it reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews ( guideline 3 ). Additionally, it suggests collective responsibility of Jews for historical events ( B.7 ), all of which align with antisemitic definitions under the JDA."

It implies that attacks on Orthodox Jews are downplayed, while those involving White suspects receive more attention, reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish people being targeted without proper reporting. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes scapegoating and denying attention to Jewish victims' suffering.",No,"After analyzing the tweet against the JDA definition and guidelines, it does not qualify as antisemitic. The content criticizes media bias regarding crime coverage based on the suspect's ethnicity, focusing on media behavior rather than directly targeting Jews or applying antisemitic stereotypes."

This generalized statement reflects a stereotype that all Jews share the same political views, which can be seen as antisemitic. It essentializes Jewish political support without recognizing individual variability and thus aligns with IHRA's definition by using harmful stereotypes about Jewish collective behavior.",Yes,"The tweet in question makes a sweeping generalization about American Jews by implying that they prioritize political ideologies (leftist movements) over their own community. According to the JDA guidelines, this type of generalized statement can be seen as antisemitic because it suggests divided loyalty and prioritizes non-Jewish identities over Jewish ones. Such statements align with the broader context of negative stereotypes about Jewish identity and loyalty, which fall under the definition of antisemitism as outlined in points 1 and 4 of the JDA. The tweet does not explicitly use traditional antisemitic tropes but still adheres to the racializing implications of making such generalizations about a specific group based on their political affiliations.

This statement simplifies a complex issue by generalizing that progressives dislike Jews collectively. IHRA defines antisemitism as including dehumanizing or stereotyping allegations about Jews as a people, such as blaming them for the dislikes of others without providing context. By linking Jews with these groups in a way that suggests a collective dislike, the tweet reflects an antisemitic perception that dismisses Jewish individuals' nuanced perspectives and experiences. Thus, it adheres to the IHRA criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet implies a negative stereotype by suggesting that ""the left"" hates Jews and associates them with liking the PLO and Iran. This grouping of Jews together without specific evidence can be seen as antisemitic, as it targets Jews collectively based on their identity rather than individual actions. It aligns with Guideline A1's warning against essentializing groups and Guidelines B7 and B8, which discuss treating Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct or requiring public condemnation simply because of their Jewish identity. Thus, the tweet's generalization and association can be interpreted as antisemitic under the JDA definition."
