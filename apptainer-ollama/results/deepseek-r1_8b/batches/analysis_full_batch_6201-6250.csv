While these events are tragic, they do not align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which typically involves current or contemporary manifestations of hate towards Jews, such as conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial, or dehumanizing stereotypes.

Therefore, based on the provided context and IHRA's definition, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question recounts historical events of violence against Jewish communities, such as forced conversions and massacres in Meknes, Fez, Baghdad, and other cities. While these incidents are well-documented cases of antisemitism from history, the JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet does not contain any current discrimination or hostility directed at Jews, nor does it promote any stereotypes or false narratives about Jewish people in a way that would classify it as antisemitic under the provided guidelines.

It critiques someone's behavior and inconsistency in their criticism, specifically pointing out that they avoid addressing Jewish groups despite discussing white supremacy. The content doesn't target Jews with negative stereotypes or harmful generalizations but rather addresses a person's selective application of criticism. Therefore, it does not align with antisemitic behavior as defined.",Yes,"The tweet implies that one ethnic group (Jews) is being treated with a double standard, requiring an apology while other groups are not addressed. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines on coded antisemitism and collective responsibility, as it suggests Jews are being unfairly targeted, fitting the definition of antisemitism."

Therefore, based on the provided criteria, this tweet is not deemed antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet specifically addresses ""Jews"" and suggests that Hindus are their fiercest allies, which may imply a collective responsibility for Jews to educate others about Hindus. This targets Jews based on their identity and could be interpreted as imposing expectations or duties on them, aligning with JDA points regarding collective responsibility and potential stereotyping."

This could align with antisemitic tropes about collective responsibilities and opposition to Jews, thus fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that non-Jews are now responsible for opposing Jews, which aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes of collective Jewish responsibility and exclusionary policies towards Jews. This framing denies the rights of Jews in Israel and implicates non-Jews in bearing the burden against Jewish identity, thus adhering to antisemitic tropes as defined by the JDA."

The statement fits the criterion of targeting Jewish communities and reflects an antisemitic trope by falsely accusing non-Jews of oppressing Jews.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It critiques two individuals, Al Sharpton and Bill de Blasio, based on their actions related to social justice issues such as encouraging riots and exploiting fake hate crimes.

This statement targets Jews based on their identity and implies their systematic removal, which aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism.

The repetition emphasizes the severity, fitting into hateful speech targeting Jews without context suggesting non-antisemitic intent.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly targets Jewish individuals in Yemen, implying they face ethnic cleansing due to their identity as Jews. This directly discriminates against them based on their religious affiliation, constituting antisemitism under the JDA definition. The repetition emphasizes the hostile nature of the statement, aligning with point 3 regarding deeds that are hostile or discriminatory against Jews as Jews. While critical of Israel's policies could be non-antisemitic (point 13), this tweet focuses on the persecution of Jewish individuals in Yemen, making it a clear case of antisemitism."

It suggests a negative belief about Jews' intentions, fitting the IHRA definition by blaming a Jewish group for harmful actions and reflecting a conspiracy theory.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic. It discriminates against Jews by coercing them to move to Israel and either convert or die, which is hostile and derogatory.

It implies that his inhumanity was reserved for certain groups, framing his actions as a justified mission rather than acknowledging the full extent of the Holocaust. This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes by scapegoating Jews and minimizing their suffering, thus violating the IHRA criteria.",Yes,"The tweet equates Hitler's atrocities with his treatment of Jews and those who opposed him, suggesting that Jews were uniquely targeted for his inhumanity. This reflects the antisemitic stereotype that Jews are linked to evil or persecution, as outlined in guideline 2 of the JDA. By focusing on Jews as the primary targets of Hitler's actions, the tweet perpetuates a harmful narrative that attributes blame and responsibility to Jews, thus conforming to the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. Additionally, while it does not explicitly reference Israel, the targeting of Jews for persecution aligns with the broader antisemitic ideology of blaming Jewish groups for societal ills or historical atrocities. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA guidelines."

This aligns with IHRA's criteria, particularly the aspect of making mendacious or stereotypical allegations by targeting Jewish people in this context, which can be seen as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet includes Jews in a list of groups being collectively blamed for societal issues. This constitutes generalized negative stereotyping, as outlined in JDA guidelines 1 and 4, which identify such behavior as antisemitic. The mention of Jews alongside other minority groups suggests a tendency to link them with blame, reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jewish people without specific justification or context."

It reflects an opinion on historical portrayal rather than antisemitic content.",Yes,"The tweet expresses frustration at a narrative that criticizes Jews for being passive during the Holocaust. This critique reinforces harmful stereotypes about Jewish behavior, potentially targeting Jews as a group rather than providing evidence-based criticism.

This phrasing implies that none might have the correct version, potentially hinting at Jews being at fault. IHRA defines antisemitism as including mendacious allegations or blaming a group for issues, which this tweet does by questioning Jewish truthfulness alongside other groups, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics. It questions various religious groups' narratives without assigning any negative stereotypes or implying a link to evil, aligning with JDA guidelines that focus on neutral comparisons rather than dehumanizing Jews."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes making mendacious allegations about Jews as part of a conspiracy theory.

Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet refers to a ""conspiracy about Jews,"" invoking a classic antisemitic trope where Jews are depicted as part of an evil or controlling group. This aligns with JDA guidelines, specifically guideline 2, which highlights the antisemitic nature of conspiracy theories linking Jews to secret or harmful influence.

While the user later describes this behavior as positive, the act of mocking Jews can be considered antisemitic under IHRA's definition, as it involves targeting Jewish individuals and perpetuates negative stereotypes about them. This aligns with examples such as accusing Jews of being responsible for actions by others, or subjecting them to verbal harassment, which falls within the scope of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not target Jews as Jews but rather comments on non-Jews' behavior towards Jews. It expresses disapproval of gentiles mocking Jews and calls such a group ""the worst."" This is a critique of others' actions, not an attack on Jews themselves or the promotion of antisemitic stereotypes. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic according to the JDA definition."

This aligns with IHRA's examples of blaming Jews collectively for negative outcomes or suggesting inadequate responses to their attacks.",Yes,"The tweet compares the NYPD's response to attacks on Jewish communities in Brooklyn in 2019 with its current handling of another situation, implying a double standard. This comparison could be interpreted as questioning Mayor de Blasio's support for Jewish communities, which might hint at coded antisemitic undertones by suggesting differential treatment based on the group being targeted. Such implications align with guideline 4 regarding indirect or coded statements that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jewish influence or priorities. Thus, this tweet adheres to the JDA definition of antisemitism as it reflects biased generalizations against a specific demographic."

This aligns with IHRA's example of using Holocaust imagery to characterize Jews or Israelis, falling under antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet draws an explicit comparison between contemporary actions and the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, which directly invokes antisemitic rhetoric. It equates Jewish suffering to that of the Holocaust, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and associating Jews with one of the most tragic chapters in history. This not only minimizes the gravity of the Holocaust but also perpetuates antisemitic sentiment by linking Jews to such atrocities, making it a clear example of antisemitic speech as defined by the JDA."
