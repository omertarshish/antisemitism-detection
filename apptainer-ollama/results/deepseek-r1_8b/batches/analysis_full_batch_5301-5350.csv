The JDA guidelines specify that criticism of political actions, even if harsh or one-sided, does not constitute antisemitism unless it directly relates to Jewish identity or involves racialized attacks against Jews. Since the tweet focuses on political credit-taking between two presidents and does not mention Jews, Israel, or any related antisemitic themes, it is not considered antisemitic."

While this could be seen as merging two distinct entities, there are no explicit references to Jews or any negative stereotypes typically associated with antisemitism.

While it refers to countries and their relationships, including Pakistan as a ""wanna be Arab,"" this does not align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which specifically involves targeting of Jews or Jewish communities. The mention of Israel's relationships with other nations and comparisons between countries like India and Pakistan do not meet the criteria for antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet does not contain any content that targets Jews or Jewish institutions.

Long live Palestine!?",Yes,"The tweet asserts that ""Israel was born out of Jewish terrorism,"" which is a conspiracy theory that blames Jews for violent acts, thus fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It also references a negative stereotype by equating Jewish identity with terrorism, targeting both Jewish individuals and the state of Israel. This meets the criteria for antisemitic behavior as it involves harmful stereotypes and blame directed at Jewish collectives.",Yes,"The tweet crosses multiple thresholds of the JDA definition. It denounces Israel's founding as rooted in Jewish terrorism (point 5) and uses Sir Gerald Kaufman's statement to imply Jews are collectively responsible for Israel's actions (points 7 and 8). By framing this, it denies Jews' right to exist in Israel (point 10) and incorporates antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish responsibility for historical events.

It frames Israel's policies in a way that could reflect antisemitic tropes, even though it doesn't explicitly mention Jews. Since antisemitism includes targeting Jewish collectivities, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic under IHRA's definition because it uses language that may be seen as blaming all Jews for the actions of the Israeli state, thus falling into the category of collective blame and stereotyping associated with antisemitic rhetoric.",No,"The tweet criticizes the Israeli government's actions regarding land acquisition and annexation but does not target Jewish people or use antisemitic tropes.
