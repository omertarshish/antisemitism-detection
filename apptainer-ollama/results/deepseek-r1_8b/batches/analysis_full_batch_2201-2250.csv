It uses Holocaust analogies to describe a group of people being starved, which trivializes and dehumanizes the victims of the Holocaust.

Therefore, the tweet is antisemitic as it blames Jews for their own suffering and uses the Holocaust analogy to reinforce harmful stereotypes and hatred towards Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet compares a situation of starvation to the Holocaust fate of Jews in Germany. This directly invokes the history of the Holocaust, referencing an event characterized by extreme antisemitism and racism (as per guideline 5). By drawing a parallel between current events and the systematic genocide of Jews, the tweet aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, as it minimizes or equates another form of violence to that suffered by Jews during the Holocaust.
