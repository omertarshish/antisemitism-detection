This aligns with IHRA's examples where accusing Jews as a collective can be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes or implying responsibility for societal issues. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic under the provided definition.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as per the JDA guidelines. It expresses concern about rising antisemitism without any negative stereotypes, hostile language, or discrimination against Jews.

My bad!,Yes,"The tweet compares the struggles of trans people in Western democracies to those of Jews during the Holocaust and African slaves, drawing parallels that could trivialize the Holocaust and equate Jewish suffering with other forms of oppression. This comparison might inadvertently reinforce antisemitic narratives by conflating distinct historical contexts and could be seen as making inappropriate or harmful associations, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through stereotypical or mendacious comparisons.",No,"The tweet compares trans people's struggles to the persecution faced by Jews in 1930s Germany and African slaves. While sensitive due to historical context, it doesn't target Jews directly but uses their suffering as a reference point for another group.

It does not meet the criteria outlined in the IHRA definition of antisemitism.,Yes,"The tweet references Mehdi's voting card as a Jewish individual involved in actions (voting for Iraq) that might negatively impact Israel. This implies a connection between Mehdi's Jewish identity and perceived negative outcomes for Israel, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes of Jews exerting undue influence. guideline B.6 applies here, as it involves applying stereotypes to Israel by linking a Jew's actions to negative consequences. Therefore, the tweet is deemed antisemitic under the JDA."

This can reinforce classical antisemitic stereotypes about Jews being a distinct group with special significance, potentially playing into harmful notions of Jewish superiority or control. By invoking this verse, the tweet may target Jews collectively, aligning with JDA guidelines that identify such content as antisemitic.

It critiques a specific instance where Jews are being targeted by police and notes the involvement of a Democrat Governor, which is a factual statement rather than an expression of antisemitism. There's no indication of blaming Jews collectively or using stereotypes associated with antisemitism. The content focuses on the situation in New York without generalizing to all Jews or implying any negative stereotype about them.",No,"The tweet does not conform to antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. It expresses concern about a specific instance of police action against Jews in New York, attributed to a political figure, but it doesn't employ racialization or classical antisemitic stereotypes. While the criticism may be one-sided, it is based on an evidence-based critique of a particular event rather than any generalized negative perception of Jews as a group. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA guidelines."

Here’s footage of German POWs being sent to Siberia. Pretty similar, huh?”",Yes,"The tweet compares the Holocaust, a genocide targeting Jews, with the treatment of German prisoners of war. This comparison equates Jewish suffering with that of non-Jews, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it uses historical atrocities to dehumanize or negatively stereotype Jews.",Yes,"The tweet compares footage of Jews being loaded into cattle cars during the Holocaust to German POWs in Siberia. This comparison equates two distinct atrocities, but the specific mention of Jews being targeted during the Holocaust directly references antisemitic historical events. By juxtaposing this with POWs, it risks trivializing the Holocaust and reinforcing a false equivalence that could incite hostility or prejudice against Jewish people. The use of such sensitive historical material in a comparison can be seen as an attempt to diminish the uniqueness of the Holocaust or imply a broader conspiracy narrative, both of which align with antisemitic themes. Thus, this tweet adheres to the JDA's definition of antisemitism by invoking harmful stereotypes and comparisons that target Jews."

While it doesn't explicitly accuse Jews of conspiracies or harmful actions, the context of religious empowerment against enemies could perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jewish identity with control over such outcomes, thereby targeting Jewish communities collectively. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves negative portrayals and potential stereotyping of Jews.",No,"The tweet refers to historical Jewish events, such as the Bani Nadir tribe and Quranic references, in a neutral and factual manner without targeting Jews for discrimination or hostility.

According to the JDA's guidelines, particularly guideline 2, this links Jews to evil forces, making it a direct example of antisemitic language.

This statement implies a hostile attitude towards Jewish people, framed as a desire for their destruction, which aligns with antisemitic hostility as defined by the JDA.
