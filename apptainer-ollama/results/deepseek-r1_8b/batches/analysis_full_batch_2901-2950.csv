This marks the beginning of extermination of Polish Jews &amp; thousands of Jews from other countries known as ""Aktion Reinhardt"" https://t.co/CiqptN3UBT https://t.co/6KP3Ifq1Zg",No,"The tweet in question does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as per the IHRA definition. It accurately references a historical event without any hateful or dehumanizing language directed towards Jews. While the content is distressing, it serves to inform about a tragic part of history rather than incite hatred or make false accusations against Jewish people. Therefore, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic under the given criteria.",No,"The tweet in question provides a historical account of a specific Nazi operation during the Holocaust. It accurately mentions ""Aktion Reinhardt,"" which is a well-documented aspect of the Nazi regime's atrocities against Jews. According to the JDA guidelines, denying or minimizing the Holocaust constitutes antisemitism (Point 5). However, this tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust but instead facts historical events. There are no elements of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as a group in the content of the tweet. The information is presented factually without any harmful stereotypes or coded language that would align with antisemitic behavior as defined by the JDA. Therefore, based on the provided guidelines and the content of the tweet, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism."

This comparison equates the platform's actions with those of a genocidal dictator, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and implying the downplay of antisemitic content. It aligns with IHRA's definition by using Nazi references to target Jews and diminish the gravity of antisemitism, thus qualifying as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet compares Jews to a genocidal figure like Hitler, using a disclaimer about disputed claims as a dismissive remark. This minimizes the Holocaust's reality, aligning with JDA guidelines that classify such actions as antisemitic (point 5). Additionally, it reflects negatively on Jews by dehumanizing them, falling under point 10 which opposes denying Jewish existence. Thus, the tweet is antisemitic."

This directly aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews as a people for various issues. While it doesn't focus on Israel, it still involves collective blame, making it antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet describes posts that collectively blame Jews for significant issues, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It involves racialized accusations against Jews, fitting the criteria outlined in the guidelines. The blaming of a specific group for various crises and terrorist actions reflects the racialized hostility towards Jews as per the JDA's understanding of antisemitism."

These dumbos don’t realise that Hindutva urges Muslims to acknowledge that we have common ancestry and want to be one people while Nazis said opposite.,No,"The tweet does not directly target Jewish individuals or promote hate against them. It critiques scholars for making comparisons involving Jews and Muslims without using antisemitic language or tropes. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria outlined by IHRA for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet compares Hindutva and Nazis, using an analogy about their approaches to diversity. It references Muslims being compared to Jews under Nazi Germany, which is a sensitive topic but not directly targeting Jews or applying antisemitic tropes. The comparison is more about political ideologies than about demeaning or stereotyping Jews, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

It uses harmful stereotypes and blaming language, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet equates the atrocities committed by Hitler against Jews with those attributed to Mohammed in a way that could imply a link between Jews and violent behavior. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly point 5 regarding Holocaust minimization and points under Israel and Palestine where comparisons can lead to antisemitic implications."

Jews don’t have to be democrats! #JEXIT! https://t.co/l4Z6Z015li,Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as it targets Jewish people by implying a manipulative friendship from Trump and suggests that Jews have specific political obligations, reinforcing antisemitic tropes about divided loyalties. It uses language that dehumanizes Jews by positioning non-Jews as their sole support, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. The mention of ""JEXIT"" and the implication that Jews don't need to be Democrats can be seen as discriminatory, urging them to exit one political group for another, thus targeting Jewish identity in a manner that fits antisemitic criteria.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic according to the JDA definition because it makes a sweeping negative generalization about Jewish political affiliations by stating ""Jews don’t have to be democrats."" This implies that all Jews share a specific political stance, which can be seen as promoting a stereotype or coded speech that aligns with classical antisemitic notions of collective judgment. The statement also risks reinforcing the idea that Jews are outside mainstream political movements, potentially contributing to discrimination against Jewish individuals based on their perceived political alignment."

This conflates a scientific discussion on Jewish heritage with antisemitic stereotypes, as it implies that such a belief equates to being antisemitic. By associating a specific historical or genetic view with antisemitism, it stigmatizes and demeans Jews as a people, fitting into the IHRA definition of antisemitism through stereotyping and mendacious allegations.",Yes,"The tweet implies that holding the belief about Ashkenazic Jews' ancestry could make one antisemitic, potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes and conspiracy theories about Jewish identity. This aligns with JDA guidelines on coded antisemitism and targeted beliefs about Jews, making it a manifestation of antisemitism."

The use of the term ""the jews"" clearly refers to Jewish people, and the action of spanking, coupled with a justification that does not negate the targeting, aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves directing harm towards Jews.",Yes,"The tweet uses ""jews"" as a target group, implying physical punishment (""spanked"") and dehumanizing them by blaming them for an alleged act of rape against a dog. This demonstrates hostility towards Jewish people as a group, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism through verbal hostility and dehumanization without specific reference to Israel."

It implies that Jewish individuals are being coerced or pressured to leave, potentially by non-Jewish entities like presidents. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, which include blaming Jews for societal issues and suggesting they are unfairly targeted. The reference to urging Jews to leave could reinforce stereotypes about Jewish communities being under threat, fitting within the framework of antisemitic discrimination as defined. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as it accuses Jews of being coerced or unfairly treated, falling into the category of rhetorical manifestations indicative of antisemitic ideology.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that a leader is forcing Jews to leave, which implies discriminatory treatment targeting Jewish individuals based on their ethnic identity. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves making negative generalizations about a group of people identified by their Jewish heritage, potentially leading to discrimination or hostility against them."

This denies the historical facts of the Holocaust, as outlined by IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes denying the scope and mechanisms of the genocide. Additionally, it collectively blames a group (Christians) for not stopping the atrocities against Jews, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and false accusations about a specific group, thus meeting several criteria of antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet refers to a situation where Jews were supposedly subjected to atrocities while Christians turned a blind eye. This implies that all Christians are complicit or indifferent, which generalizes an entire group (Christians) negatively and reinforces antisemitic stereotypes. It also ties into the narrative that Jews are victimized without agency, aligning with classic antisemitic beliefs. Additionally, the implication of a cover-up during significant historical events can be seen as minimizing or denying the gravity of such atrocities, further contributing to antisemitic undertones. Therefore, this tweet adheres to the definitions outlined in the JDA, indicating antisemitic content."

It’s not antisemitic to state the truth. He is evil!",Yes,"The tweet crosses into antisemitic territory by inaccurately blaming George Soros for actions he didn't directly commit, such as the Holocaust, and using his role to imply responsibility beyond individual agency. It also dismisses the gravity of Holocaust denial, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and narratives that align with antisemitic discourse.",Yes,"The tweet in question invokes antisemitic tropes by associating George Soros's Jewish identity with his past actions during the Holocaust. While the content refers to factual events, it uses these facts to promote negative stereotypes about Jews, thereby crossing into antisemitic territory as defined by the JDA. By linking a Jewish individual to harmful historical actions and casting judgment based on ethnicity, the tweet discriminates against Jews as Jews, aligning with the JDA's guidelines that classify such behavior as antisemitic."

It does not deny or downplay the Holocaust, nor does it make false allegations, use stereotypes, or target Jewish individuals or institutions. Instead, it presents factual information based on research, aiming to increase awareness rather than promote antisemitic views.",No,"The tweet reports a statistic about young adults' awareness of Holocaust victim numbers, which is factual and does not deny or minimize the Holocaust. It's neutral and informative, not targeting Jews negatively. Thus, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA."

While it discusses the impact of antisemitism on Jewish individuals, it doesn't present any specific examples of harmful stereotypes or collective blame directed at Jews, which are key indicators of antisemitism according to IHRA's definition. Therefore, the tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior as defined.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that two-thirds of UK Jews were considering leaving due to antisemitism (AS). According to the JDA, this constitutes discrimination against Jews based on their identity. It implies a negative generalization about Jewish individuals being targeted because of their ethnicity, falling under point 3's definition of antisemitism. Additionally, if this AS is linked to broader stereotypes or indirect hostility towards Jews, it aligns with point 4's criteria for coded antisemitism. Thus, the tweet's statement reflects antisemitic elements as defined by the JDA."

Antisemitism involves targeting Jewish individuals or their community, and incitement to violence against Jews fits this criterion. The mention of a pandemic doesn't absolve the content of its antisemitic nature; instead, it highlights the context in which such rhetoric is being spread. This aligns with examples provided by IHRA, where blaming a group for harm against Jews qualifies as antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question reports on an incident where Palestinians are accused of inciting violence against Jews during a pandemic. According to the JDA definition, antisemitism specifically targets Jewish people based on their identity. This tweet does not directly attack Jews as a group or use classical antisemitic stereotypes; instead, it addresses actions taken by Palestinians without targeting Jews for being Jewish. Therefore, under the provided guidelines, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism."

It begins by questioning if Jews are a problem, which can be seen as dehumanizing. The phrase ""duffing them up"" implies violence against Jews. Targeting specific Jewish relatives and referencing violent actions in Palestine reinforces antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish behavior. This overall context uses negative generalizations and violence towards Jews, fitting the definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet contains several elements indicative of antisemitism. It starts with a question that generalizes Jews as a ""problem,"" which is a sweeping negative stereotype (Guideline A1). The mention of ""duffing them up"" implies violence against Jews, aligning with antisemitic actions described in Guideline A3. Additionally, referencing violent behavior in Palestine can be seen as linking Jews to such actions, reinforcing classical antisemitic stereotypes (Guideline A2). The overall context collectively blames Jews for violence and issues, which falls under the definition of antisemitism by targeting Jews based on their identity, potentially inciting harm against them. Guideline B7 also supports this conclusion by highlighting collective responsibility based on Jewishness, as the tweet suggests attacking relatives for being Jewish. Thus, the content meets the criteria for antisemitism."

While it mentions Jews as part of the impact, it does not present any antisemitic content such as conspiracy theories, stereotypes, or hate speech directed at Jewish individuals. Instead, it focuses on criticizing organizational policies, making it a matter of opposing ideology rather than antisemitism.",No,"The tweet does not align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It criticizes the ADL, an organization, for its actions affecting various groups, but it doesn't target Jews as a racial or ethnic group with harmful stereotypes or stigmatizing language. The focus is on organizational conduct rather than discrimination against Jews. Thus, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

If it is an editorial only accusing Jews then I'd agree, but I haven't seen that article.",Yes,"The tweet references an article from Canary that allegedly accuses Jews of weaponizing antisemitism. According to the IHRA definition, this can be considered antisemitic as it collectively blames Jewish individuals for using antisemitism against others, aligning with examples like making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews. Such statements have the potential to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to antisemitic rhetoric, thereby meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to an article that accuses Jews of weaponizing antisemitism. According to the JDA definition, this directly links Jews with harmful actions, constituting antisemitism by associating a group with negative stereotypes. Even without the article's content, the implication of Jews being responsible for such actions meets the criteria for antisemitic speech, as it delegitimizes Jewish identity and creates a hostile environment through stereotyping. Thus, the tweet is considered antisemitic."

It uses a historical reference from Jewish religious texts to critique the application of Old Testament theology, without targeting Jews or reinforcing stereotypes. The content is more about critiquing divine actions rather than dehumanizing or blaming Jewish individuals collectively.",Yes,"The tweet references a biblical story involving Jewish characters and uses language that could be interpreted as dehumanizing or reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews, aligning with the antisemitic criteria outlined by the JDA. Specifically, it connects Jews with negative outcomes (God causing problems) and may trivialize their historical struggles, contributing to a prejudicial context against the Jewish community."

This trivializes the Holocaust and employs mendacious comparisons that demean Jews, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through dehumanizing language and harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet replaces ""slavery"" for ""the Holocaust,"" trivializing the Holocaust, a grave atrocity, and uses derogatory terms towards Jews (""damn jews"").

While the title focuses on aiding Jews, there is no evidence of negative or harmful content directed at Jews. The actions described—such as underlining and adding flowers—are neutral or positive gestures rather than manifestations of antisemitism. Thus, this does not align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which involves hateful or harmful behaviors targeting Jews or Jewish communities.",No,"The tweet describes an incident where a roommate left a pamphlet with highlighted sections and flowers. While highlighting could be interpreted as drawing attention, there's no indication of intent to demean or harm Jews. The context suggests a humorous observation rather than antisemitic behavior.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes any manifestation that targets Jewish individuals or collectively blames them for events. While the tweet refers to a past incident, it can be seen as perpetuating negative perceptions of Jews by highlighting their suffering during a time of heightened antisemitism. Thus, the content aligns with the criteria outlined in IHRA's examples, making it classified as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet describes an instance of racial humiliation against Jews in 1938, where Jews were forced by the Nazis to perform menial tasks. This act is a direct example of violence against Jews as Jews, fitting the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

The inclusion of Jews alongside other ethnicities suggests an unintended but pernicious association, fitting the criteria of antisemitic discourse.",Yes,"The tweet includes Jews in a comparison of groups, implying that together they cannot account for the number of blacks killed. This suggests an inherent stereotype about blacks being more prone to violence, which aligns with classical antisemitic notions linking certain groups to negative outcomes.
