It targets Jewish individuals by questioning their identity and belonging based on their socioeconomic status, implying that working-class Jewish people may not truly be Jewish or deserve recognition as such. This approach aligns with broader antisemitic narratives that devalue Jewish people by suggesting their identity is conditional rather than inherent. The instruction to ""focus on your own community"" further reinforces the idea of collective responsibility and discrimination against Jews, which fits within the guidelines outlined in the JDA for identifying antisemitism."

Without more context, this assessment is cautious but based on the possibility of such implications."

This aligns with classical antisemitic tropes that link Jews to negativity and dehumanization. Additionally, it treats a character trait (being Jewish) as inherent in a harmful way, falling under the definition of racism applied to antisemitism.
