These people are sick and evil! https://t.co/jG7QhAhfxX,Yes,"The tweet references rounding up Jews, which evokes historical antisemitic stereotypes and incites harm against Jewish people. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves dehumanizing allegations targeting a Jewish group.",Yes,"The tweet references rounding up Jews, which directly ties to the Holocaust, a grave antisemitic act. It uses pejorative language to describe Jewish individuals, aligning with classical antisemitic stereotypes.

I've never understood why.  What say you?  https://t.co/q9bFUayHys,Yes,"The tweet targets American Jews by implying their political support is due to inherent loyalty or group interests, which aligns with antisemitic tropes of collective responsibility and stereotyping. It suggests that Jews are at fault for the anti-Semitic and pro-Islamist stances of the Left, thereby blaming them as a group for these actions. This approach meets the IHRA definition of antisemitism by associating Jews with negative policies and using stereotypes to critique their support.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language and implications that align with antisemitic tropes. It criticizes American Jews for their political support while associating the Left with antisemitism and Islamism. This not only targets Jewish individuals for their beliefs but also potentially reinforces stereotypes linking Jews with negative influences, as defined by the JDA guidelines. The mention of ""rampant antisemitic"" stances implies a broader stigma on Jewish supporters, which can be seen as a form of coded language that reflects harmful stereotypes about Jewish influence and conspiracies. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA definition."

Additionally, the phrase ""'Muslims Will Destroy The Crusade'"" can be interpreted as a threat or incitement against Jews and Christians, contributing to antisemitic rhetoric by collectively blaming them. This aligns with IHRA's definition, which includes actions that target Jewish groups with harmful stereotypes or accusations, thus indicating antisemitism.",No,"The tweet discusses a protest by Muslims in London against Jews and Christians, with a chant referencing ""Destroying the Crusade,"" and links this to a political statement about gun control. While it mentions multiple groups, there's no direct targeting of Jews with classic antisemitic tropes or incitement against them specifically. The focus is on religious protest and political commentary rather than specific antisemitic content directed at Jewish people. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined."

Ethiopia Jews have lots in common with other Jewish people.,Yes,"The tweet contains language that could be interpreted as antisemitic. It suggests that individuals who hold negative views about Jews are not genuine Jews, which can be seen as blaming all Jews for such sentiments. Additionally, it implies a hierarchy of Jewish identity based on commonalities, potentially reinforcing stereotypes and exclusionary thinking. While the intention may be to correct a misunderstanding, the phrasing risks perpetuating antisemitic undertones by distinguishing between true and non-true Jews. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it can deny opportunities or services to non-Ethiopian Jews, which is illegal in many countries.",Yes,"The tweet is antisemitic as it dismisses individuals who hold negative opinions about Jews as non-Jewish, thus denegrating the Jewish community and implying a negative stereotype. This aligns with the JDA's guidelines regarding the denial of equal rights to Jews and the association of certain views with non-Jewish identity, potentially reflecting coded language and harmful generalizations."

While it may reflect discomfort with the global Jewish population and religious practices, it does not exhibit discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group.

This statement reinforces negative stereotypes and perceptions about Jewish people, potentially aligning with antisemitic themes by suggesting the subjugation of Jews under Arab rule. It targets Jewish individuals based on their identity, fitting within IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it involves a perception that could incite harm or discrimination against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet ""@DanielSeidemann Fantastic news, Arab rule over majority Jews."" is considered antisemitic according to the JDA. It implies that a Jewish population is being ruled by Arabs, which can be interpreted as a negative stereotype where Jews are seen as vulnerable or dominated, aligning with classical antisemitic notions of Jewish subjugation and collective blame. This statement targets Jews as a group, fitting the definition of antisemitism through its implication of racialized dominance and potentialized harm to the Jewish community."

Hitler knew the Jews were just using selfish paranoia, that's why they weren't allowed to defend themselves.",Yes,"The tweet compares Jewish people's behavior to that of a group led by Hitler, using the Nazi perspective to critique Jews. This aligns with IHRA examples of using Nazi comparisons as antisemitic, thereby trivializing the Holocaust and perpetuating harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet employs antisemitic language by referring to Jews using ""selfish paranoia"" as a tactic, which aligns with classical stereotypes that depict Jews as manipulative and controlling. It also falsely attributes Hitler's actions against Jews, reinforcing the notion that Jews cannot defend themselves, thereby justifying anti-Semitic beliefs. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly points 2, 3, and 5, which highlight the use of negative stereotypes and Holocaust-related rhetoric to spread antisemitism."

It lists Jews/Israel as part of a broader conspiracy, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes blaming Jews for societal issues using harmful stereotypes. The mention of Jews being responsible for conspiracies fits into the antisemitic framework of attributing negative actions to Jewish groups, thus qualifying this tweet as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet groups conspiracy theorists into three categories, including ""The Jews/Israel,"" which links Jews to potential secret power or influence. According to JDA guidelines, especially points 6 and 10, applying negative stereotypes or implying hidden Jewish power can be antisemitic. While the Fed reference may not be directly antisemitic, its inclusion alongside Jews in a conspiracy context aligns with coded antisemitic language by associating Jews with negative stereotypes of secret influence. This grouping could reinforce classical antisemitic ideas, making the tweet fall under antisemitic discourse as defined by JDA."

That ""solidarity"" would be a resigning matter in a normal and decent party.  Labour is no such party.",Yes,"The tweet implies that a Labour MP is associating with individuals who have committed acts against Jews. According to the IHRA definition, this constitutes making mendacious or dehumanizing allegations about the MP's stance, thereby fitting into the antisemitic category. Antisemitism often involves blaming a collective for actions committed by others, and this tweet does so by linking the MP to individuals who have harmed Jews, thus aligning with the IHRA examples provided.",Yes,"The tweet references political prisoners as ""terrorist murderers of Jews,"" directly linking them to violence against Jews. This explicitly associates Jews with criminal acts, reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes and hostility towards the Jewish community. By describing these individuals as murderers, the tweet dehumanizes Jews and reinforces harmful biases, thereby violating the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination, prejudice, and hostility against Jews."

It accuses Jewish individuals of holding antisemitic views, links their political support (BDS) with radicalism, and stereotypes them as racist. These actions collectively contribute to a perception that Jews are responsible for negative outcomes, thereby meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet includes several elements that align with antisemitic content according to the JDA. It uses derogatory terms like ""antisemites,"" equates Muslims with Nazis, and makes broad stereotypes about American Jews supporting harmful political stances and behaviors.

Wouldn�t the Left be on board for most of this? https://t.co/LCsEQoS5mO,Yes,"The tweet invokes antisemitic imagery by referencing the rounding up of Jews, a direct reference to the Holocaust, and draws a comparison to Nazi policies. It further ties this to a suggestion that leftist ideologies might support such actions, reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish threat and association with extremism. These elements align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes hate speech targeting Jews and linking them to historical atrocities or conspiracies.",Yes,"The tweet draws a chilling comparison between Bill de Blasio's remarks about rounding up Jews and actions taken by the Nazis. It also suggests that left-wing political positions might align with Nazi policies (as per items 7 and 11-17 of the Nazi platform), equating progressive ideologies with antisemitic or Nazi-like behaviors. By invoking Holocaust references and linking Jews collectively to such actions, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and antisemitic associations, violating the JDA's guidelines against discrimination and prejudice against Jewish populations. The comparison trivializes the atrocities of the Holocaust and erroneously associates Jewish identity with negative policies, thus conforming to forms of antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

While the exact content of the linked article is not accessible, the description indicates an attempt to connect COVID-19 with Jewish individuals or groups, particularly in relation to Israel. According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism includes discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, and it can manifest through conspiracy theories or coded language that associates Jews with negative forces or events. Blaming a health crisis on a specific group, especially one that is already stereotypically associated with conspiracies (as per guideline 2), constitutes antisemitism.

This implies that he prioritizes Jewish national interests over others, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish dominance and manipulation. By linking Gantz's actions to a Zionist agenda, the tweet employs classic antisemitic themes, associating Jews collectively with harmful political tactics against non-Jews. Such accusations reflect the IHRA definition of antisemitism by employing negative stereotypes about Jewish collective behavior, thus making the tweet antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Gantz is using Palestinians to achieve his political goals, which are tied to the ""Greater Israel plan.""

While this is a historical event tied to Jewish heritage, the context here applies it in a way that could imply targeting Jews as a group with a negative stereotype.

The phrase suggests that Jews are being nailed or suffer on this day, which can be interpreted as derogatory and discriminatory, thus falling under antisemitic rhetoric."

The mention of the ""final solution,"" a direct reference to the Holocaust, is deeply offensive and reinforces harmful associations (guideline 5). Additionally, it generalizes all Jews as supporting such a regime, fitting guideline 1's criticism of essentializing groups. The financial criticism may also contribute to antisemitic tropes about Jewish wealth.

This creates an association that reflects broader biases, potentially linking Jewish worshipers with others in a context that could be seen as targeting them.
