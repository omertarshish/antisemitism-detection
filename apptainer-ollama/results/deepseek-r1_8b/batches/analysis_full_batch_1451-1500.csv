Tensions are escalating. https://t.co/rcRw6EslJI",No,"The tweet discusses Israeli Police allowing Jewish individuals into a religious site during Ramadan, which is a matter of political tension. It does not involve any hateful or conspiratorial statements about Jews, nor does it falsely accuse them of wrongdoing or deny historical facts. There's no indication of stereotyping or blaming Jews as a collective for harm. Therefore, under IHRA's definition, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet reports on an event involving Israeli Police and the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif during Ramadan. It describes a decision allowing hundreds of Jews into the site for the first time in years, which is a sensitive and contentious matter. While tensions are mentioned as escalating, the tweet does not contain any language or imagery that reflects antisemitic stereotypes or hostility toward Jews as a group. There is no indication of blaming all Jews for Israel's actions, nor is there any generalized negative characterization of Jewish people. Instead, the tweet appears to be a factual account of a political decision affecting a holy site during a significant religious period. As such, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA, which requires discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence specifically targeting Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions."

Our Framers were brilliant... learn more!,Yes,"The tweet includes statements referencing historical antisemitic actions targeting Jews during the Holocaust. It equates the registration of guns by Jews under Nazi rule with their subsequent deportation to trains, which is a well-documented aspect of the Holocaust. By invoking this history, the tweet dehumanizes Jews and reinforces harmful stereotypes, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. The comparison to the Framers and suggestion that current situations mirror such actions also contribute to a negative portrayal of Jews. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as per IHRA standards.",Yes,"The tweet references historical antisemitic events, specifically the Holocaust, by describing Jews being forced to register their guns and then marched to trains—a direct reference to Nazi policies. According to JDA guidelines, denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered antisemitic ( guideline 5 ). Additionally, the tweet uses stereotypes associating Jews with these atrocities, which falls under the category of applying negative generalizations about Jews as a group ( guideline 1 ). Therefore, this tweet is antisemitic."

They all reject each other without this standard. Don't play their game.

It generally criticizes the practice of requiring advanced degrees to critique various religions without directly implicating Jews or spreading harmful stereotypes about them.",No,"The tweet discusses a requirement for specialized knowledge to critique various religions, including Judaism. It does not specifically target Jews as a group with negative stereotypes or imply that Jews are linked to evil forces. Instead, it critiques the practice of requiring expertise in religious studies to comment on them. This approach is not antisemitic under the JDA guidelines, which focus on race-based discrimination rather than general criticism of ideologies."

Antisemitism can involve stereotypes or negative depictions of Jews as a collective, which may apply if the image links to harmful stereotypes or misinformation about Ashkenazi Jews. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, particularly in its application through harmful stereotypes or mendacious allegations, potentially qualifying the tweet as such.",Yes,"The tweet refers to ""Ashkenazi Jews"" during Erev Pesach. While mentioning a Jewish cultural practice isn't inherently antisemitic, the reference could imply negative stereotypes or link Ashkenazi Jews to harmful antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies or evil forces. This aligns with JDA guidelines that classify such associations as antisemitic, especially if they involve treating a group with prejudice or hostility based on their identity as Jews."

There is no evidence of antisemitic content, stereotypes, or harmful accusations about Jewish people. The phrase does not target Jews negatively but rather critiques behavior, so it doesn't fit the definition of antisemitism as per IHRA guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet uses the phrase ""Fellow Jews"" to refer to a situation that may imply collective negative characteristics of Jewish people. If the linked content discusses Jewish issues in a way that reinforces antisemitic stereotypes or negative associations, this could be seen as targeting Jewish identity. According to JDA guidelines, applying classical antisemitic tropes or stigmatizing Jewish groups collectively can be considered antisemitic. Therefore, without more context, it is plausible that the tweet aligns with antisemitic language as defined by the JDA."

It is a protest against attacks on Jews, which aligns with opposing hate rather than promoting or supporting it. There are no elements like denying the Holocaust, blaming Jews for wrongdoing, or using harmful stereotypes. Instead, it reflects a stance against antisemitic actions.",No,"The tweet by Michael Davitt from 1904 does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the JDA definition. Davitt is reacting to attacks on Jews in Limerick and protesting against violence directed at Jewish individuals. His statement identifies himself as an Irishman and Catholic, emphasizing his stance against the malicious treatment of Jews. This response is a defense against antisemitism rather than an expression of it. Therefore, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by the JDA."

Under the IHRA definition, this constitutes antisemitism as it involves targeting Jewish individuals with a harmful stereotype or reference to historical atrocities. Even if intended as a joke, such language perpetuates antisemitic ideas and should be taken seriously, regardless of the speaker's intent.",Yes,"The tweet includes the phrase ""gas the Jews,"" which evokes harmful stereotypes and associations with the Holocaust, as outlined in JDA guideline 5. Even though presented as a joke by a far-right figure who was invited on the BBC, the use of such language contributes to antisemitic rhetoric by linking Jews to violence. This aligns with antisemitism's historical ties to evil conspiracies (guideline 2) and reflects coded or subtle antisemitic speech (guideline 4). The implication of a double standard further highlights how antisemitism can manifest in various forms, including through coded language and dismissive remarks that perpetuate negative stereotypes. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

You mentioned how Jews of European descent claimed ""whiteness"" post-holocaust so strongly at the cost of POC. Do you think this is in any way part of the Israeli treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank?",No,"The tweet does not exhibit elements of antisemitism as defined by IHRA. It discusses a historical aspect about Jewish identity post-Holocaust and its implications on POC communities, without attacking Jews or blaming them collectively for harm. The focus is on cultural dynamics rather than hatred towards Jewish individuals or communities.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly incite hatred or violence against Jews and instead poses a hypothetical question about historical and political dynamics. While it connects Jewish identity with whiteness and discusses Israeli policies, the statement lacks direct antisemitic content or intent.

It lacks any direct manifestation of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet references ""American Jews"" trending and interprets this negatively. According to JDA guidelines (A.1), sweeping negative generalizations about any population, especially targeting a specific group like Jews, can be antisemitic. While the tweet doesn't explicitly mention stereotypes linked directly to classical antisemitism, the implication of negativity towards American Jews based on their prominence in trends reflects discrimination against them as a group, thus adhering to antisemitic principles."

It critiques a non-Jewish publication and an author's stance on Islamophobia, without targeting Jews or using antisemitic stereotypes or allegations about Jewish people. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to the IHRA criteria.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic behavior according to the JDA definition because it focuses on criticizing an article about Islamophobia without targeting Jews or Jewish institutions.

This chant targets Jewish people as an invasive group and reflects the stereotype that Jews are collectively replacing others. Additionally, the tweet asserts that anti-Semitism has always been part of the Right's platform, reinforcing the belief that Jews are to blame for societal issues. This aligns with classic antisemitic narratives, such as blaming Jews for conspiracies or societal problems. The reference to Charlottesville, where white supremacists and antisemitic groups were active, further contextualizes the harmful stereotype. Therefore, the tweet meets the criteria outlined by IHRA for antisemitism, including dehumanizing language and stereotyping of Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet references the Charlottesville incident where a group chanted an antisemitic phrase. This directly targets Jewish individuals by using a classic antisemitic trope. Additionally, the tweet asserts that anti-Semitism is a plank of the Right's platform, which generalizes negatively about a political group and links them to antisemitism.

While the metaphors are strong, they don't incite hatred or blame Jews for wrongdoing. The focus is on achievement and survival rather than targeting Jews with antisemitic intent.",Yes,"The tweet uses metaphors and language that stereotype Jews in a negative manner, evoking common antisemitic tropes about Jewish manipulation and dominance. It likens Jews to hunters after a history of being hunted, which reinforces harmful stereotypes.

This statement can be interpreted as a form of discrimination against Jews based on their political beliefs. According to the JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions, and this statement reflects a negative generalization about a subset of Jews, potentially excluding them from being considered part of the Jewish community.
