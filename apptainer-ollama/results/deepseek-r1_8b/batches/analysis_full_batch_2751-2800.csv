This invokes historical antisemitic rhetoric by linking current events to the Nazi era, which trivializes the Holocaust and associates Jews with being targeted. Such language suggests a harmful conspiracy against Jews, aligning with classic antisemitic themes of Jew Hatred as outlined in the JDA. Therefore, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic."

This acknowledges their resilience and contribution to saving lives during a dark period. While the word ""harbor"" might have unintended connotations, in this context, it appears to be part of a title recognizing the Jewish community's role in providing refuge. The content does not exhibit antisemitic elements such as hatred, conspiracy theories, or stereotypes; instead, it highlights a positive historical aspect, thus not conforming to the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet ""Harbor From the Holocaust: The Jews of Shanghai"" is likely considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition. While it purports to tell a story about Jewish experiences, the use of the term ""harbor"" alongside the Holocaust reference and the potential commercial angle may subtly reinforce negative stereotypes or exploit historical trauma for profit, aligning with antisemitic tropes that link Jews to exploitation or manipulation."

This aligns with JDA guidelines 7 and 10, which state that holding Jews collectively responsible for Israeli conduct (as agents of a non-Jewish power) and denying their right to exist as Jews are antisemitic actions. The tweet's implication that Jewish identity in Israel is compromised or manipulated by colonial forces reflects a form of indirect antisemitism by questioning the authenticity of Jewish presence and representation in Israel."

Antisemitism involves stereotyping and making generalizations about Jewish people as a group, often attributing negative characteristics collectively. Here, white Jews are implicated in a harmful stereotype suggesting they inherently may engage in racist behavior. This reflects antisemitic tropes that reduce individual agency and blame entire ethnic groups, thus contributing to discrimination and harm. Therefore, the tweet is deemed antisemitic by IHRA's criteria.",Yes,"The tweet states that ""white Jews are not exempt from being racist,"" which implies that Jewish individuals, particularly white ones, may exhibit racist behavior. This statement aligns with antisemitic tropes by linking Jewish identity to negative characteristics, as per JDA guidelines. While it doesn't explicitly target Jews for harm, it reinforces harmful stereotypes and could contribute to discrimination against the Jewish community. Therefore, it falls under antisemitism as defined by JDA."

It is a theological question comparing two groups without any explicit hateful or stereotypical content directed at Jewish individuals. The statement does not involve blaming Jews for societal issues, making mendacious accusations, or denying the Holocaust, nor does it imply harm towards Jews. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet raises a question that compares Samaritans and Jews in a manner suggesting that neither group is particularly favored by God. This implication could be interpreted as a veiled negative stereotype about Jewish people, aligning with antisemitic tropes where Jewish individuals are depicted as not being as blessed or favored as others. Such comparisons can contribute to the perception of discrimination against Jews, thereby falling under the definition of antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

The focus is on collective action against policy issues, not on targeting Jews.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by JDA. It involves Orthodox Jews protesting against Cuomo's actions regarding synagogue closures, which is a political and community issue, not targeting Jews for their Judaism.

The term ""Hebrew"" is closely associated with Jewish identity, and using it to describe Black individuals can perpetuate harmful stereotypes linking them to Jewishness. This association can be seen as antisemitic, as it inaccurately connects Black people to a specific religious or cultural group, potentially causing offense and reinforcing negative perceptions. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Nick Cannon's use of the term ""true Hebrews"" to describe Black people, which links Jewish identity (""Hebrew"") to Black people. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes that associate Jews with other groups, as per antisemitic tropes in guideline 2.

What a schmendrick. https://t.co/hCN0MMtq43,Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language (""schmendrick"") directed at American Jews, implying they don't identify with America but instead with Israel. This dismisses Jewish individuals' connections to their birth country and reduces them to being out of touch or disloyal, which aligns with antisemitic tropes that question Jewish loyalty. The use of such language dehumanizes and diminishes the identity of Jewish individuals, fitting IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language that aligns with antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA definition. Specifically, it assumes American Jews have a loyalty to Israel that supersedes their identification as Americans, which is covered under guideline B.9 of the JDA. This assumption can lead to discrimination against Jewish individuals for their heritage, fitting the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews. The use of the term ""schmendrick"" while implying a stereotype about Jewish loyalty adds to its coded nature, making it an indirect form of antisemitic speech. Thus, the tweet is found to be antisemitic based on the provided guidelines."

This comparison can reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish influence over powerful nations, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through its focus on perceived conspiracies and double standards.",No,"The tweet compares Germany's reparations for the Holocaust (against Jews) with their refusal to pay reparations for the genocide against Namibians. While it acknowledges the disparity in treatment based on power dynamics, it does not explicitly target Jews as a group or use antisemitic imagery or language.

It plays into stereotypes about Jewish influence and criticizes Jews for dictating policies, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism. The implication that Jewish survival is in question also evokes harmful conspiracy-like thinking. Thus, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitic expression.",Yes,"The tweet targets American Jews for criticizing Israel's actions, implying they have a luxury not afforded to others. This aligns with JDA guidelines 7 and 8, which highlight collective responsibility and required public condemnations.

According to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition, antisemitism involves perceptions or actions that target Jews with hatred or prejudice, such as blaming them for situations or using harmful stereotypes. However, this tweet does not express any hatred towards Jews nor does it imply any negative connotations about Jewish individuals. It merely describes an auction sale of abandoned properties, which can be a neutral event, especially in the context of historical deportation, without evidence of intent to demean or harm Jews. Therefore, based on the provided information and the IHRA definition, this tweet does not constitute antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references an auction sale of properties left by Jews after their deportation, a context tied to historical antisemitic events such as the Holocaust. While not explicitly denying the Holocaust, it implies a negative view of Jewish individuals being expelled and their property sold. This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes and discrimination against Jews, as outlined in the JDA guidelines, particularly regarding the forced removal and exploitation of Jewish assets. Therefore, this tweet can be considered antisemitic."

According to the IHRA definition, this falls under the category of making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective, specifically the myth of a Jewish conspiracy. By falsely accusing Jews of such a plot, the tweet aligns with the antisemitic examples provided, as it dehumanizes and unfairly blames a Jewish group for societal issues. Thus, the content is considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet describes a conspiracy where Jews are depicted as dominating the world through money and intelligence, targeting Christians. This aligns with classic antisemitic tropes that link Jews to evil conspiracies (see JDA Guidelines A2).

This aligns with antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA, where actions are directed at Jewish individuals or perceived Jewish properties. It involves collectively targeting Jews, reminiscent of historical persecution and reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies or collective responsibility. The act of searching for Jews in buildings can be seen as an overreach or bias, falling under antisemitic discrimination by denying opportunities to Jews without cause. Thus, the tweet's implication of authorities targeting Jews fits within the IHRA framework of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet refers to authorities checking buildings for Jews, which evokes historical antisemitic actions like the Holocaust, where Jewish people were systematically targeted. This reference implies a comparison to past atrocities, highlighting discrimination against Jews based on their identity.

Antisemitism, according to the IHRA definition, involves targeting Jewish individuals or entities due to their identity. While the protest may focus on Palestinian issues, the harassment directed at Jews specifically constitutes antisemitic behavior as it targets individuals based on their religious identity rather than broader political or ideological disagreements. This aligns with the IHRA examples of antisemitism, particularly when the actions involve dehumanizing or targeting Jewish people, regardless of the protest's primary cause. Therefore, the tweet reflects antisemitic behavior under the given definition.",Yes,"The tweet describes pro-Palestinian protesters harassing Jews in NYC.
