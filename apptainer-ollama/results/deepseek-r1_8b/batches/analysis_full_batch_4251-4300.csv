Point 1 refers to a conspiracy theory about Jewish control, which is a classic antisemitic stereotype. Point 2 omits Jewish victims in Holocaust discourse, amounting to denial, as per IHRA. Point 3 blames Jews for societal issues, another form of collective accusation. Each element fits into the defined antisemitic behaviors, thus categorizing the tweet as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references three points that collectively reflect antisemitic elements. First, it notes a survey indicating beliefs about Jewish control, which relates to negative stereotypes (A1). Second, omitting Jews in Holocaust discussions minimizes their suffering (A5). Third, blaming Jews for election defeats is a conspiracy theory linked to evil associations (A2 and A4). Each point aligns with JDA guidelines, making the tweet antisemitic."

A thread üßµ,Yes,"The tweet describes a situation where a Jewish individual and his family were targeted due to their ethnicity, specifically being forced to leave their home in Jerusalem before Israel's establishment. This directly aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes harm towards Jewish individuals or their property based on their ethnic identity.",No,"The tweet describes a family's historical experience of displacement in Jerusalem, attributing it to ""Arab"" attacks. It does not target Jews for being Jewish nor imply any negative stereotypes about Jews. There is no suggestion of classical antisemitic elements like linking Jews to evil or conspiracies.

Jesus went into detail elaborating why God was permissive about marriage towards the Jews but made it clear that God's design is for one man and one wife.,Yes,"The tweet references Jews in a stereotypical manner regarding marriage practices, suggesting leniency specific to them. This aligns with IHRA's definition by using negative stereotypes and blaming a group collectively, which qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Jewish religious practices in a manner that could be interpreted as bestowing undue privileges on Jews, potentially suggesting superiority or exclusion. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includescoded statements implying negative stereotypes about Jewish groups. By linking God's design to benefit Jews in matters like marriage and divorce, the tweet likely intends to dehumanize non-Jews or suggest unfair advantages for Jews, thus falling under antisemitic guidelines."

It implies that Jews were a driving force behind capitalism, mirroring classic antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish conspiracies.

While it acknowledges Jewish suffering, the phrasing may reduce Judaism to a personal or cultural perspective without addressing antisemitic contexts. This could be seen as delegitimizing or stereotyping Jews by focusing on their history in a way that might imply responsibility for their persecution, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through mendacious allegations and blaming collective groups.",Yes,"The tweet invokes classical antisemitic tropes by comparing Jewish experiences to those of other groups and questioning the uniqueness of Jewish suffering, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

It references comparing individuals to Jews in Nazi Germany, which is a form of Holocaust trivialization and antisemitic rhetoric. Additionally, it mentions ""antisemitic conspiracies about the Rothschilds,"" a well-known antisemitic stereotype. These elements fit into the broader IHRA examples of antisemitism, such as accusing Jews of conspiring or using harmful stereotypes, thereby meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet references antisemitic conspiracies about Jewish families like the Rothschilds and compares actions to Nazi analogies.

This perspective can be seen as an accusation against Jewish individuals, fitting the IHRA definition by targeting Jewish people collectively and reflecting harmful stereotypes about their loyalty. While criticism of Israel is not inherently antisemitic, this statement generalizes about US Jews in a way that reinforces negative portrayals of Jewish identity, making it an example of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet discusses the perspective that many US Jews may not love Israel. It is a statement about differing opinions within the Jewish diaspora regarding Israeli policies and does not reflect antisemitic content, as it doesn't involve stereotypes, discrimination, or hostility against Jews based on their identity."

This comparison invokes the Holocaust, using language that aligns with antisemitic tropes by associating current events with historical atrocities against Jews. Such analogies and the use of terms like ""concentration camp"" can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and negatively target Jewish people, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet compares a situation in Australia to concentration camps and mentions the Nazis disarming Jews before herding them, drawing an offensive parallel to the Holocaust. This associational language can trivialize Jewish suffering and reinforce antisemitic stereotypes by linking non-Jewish issues to historical Jewish persecution, thus falling under the definition of antisemitism as provided by the JDA."

This aligns with IHRA's examples, as it uses historical context to falsely accuse Jews of being responsible for their persecution, a form of blaming them collectively for their circumstances. It also equates criticism of Israel with antisemitic ideology, which is indicative of mendacious allegations and double standards against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet asserts that Antizionism is antisemitism disguised as a reason to hate and blame Jews for their own oppression. This aligns with JDA guidelines, particularly points 2 and 4, which highlight the reinforcement of negative stereotypes about Jews being linked to evil forces or conspiracies and the use of coded language to target Jewish identity collectively. The tweet implies that criticism of Zionism is an antisemitic stance used against Jews, fitting into categories such as holding them responsible for collective oppression (point 7) and using indirect, coded language to discriminate (points 2 and 4).

It draws an inappropriate analogy between the Nazis' hatred of Jews and current situations, blaming Jews for the Nazis' actions by portraying them as victims. This rhetoric aligns with mendacious allegations about Jews as a collective, stereotyping political ideologies, and using historical comparisons that reinforce harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet compares Jews to the Nazis, suggesting that both groups experienced victimhood at each other's hands.

It does not fit the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which involves blaming Jews collectively for wrongdoing or denying historical facts.",Yes,"The tweet associates Jews with violence against Palestinians and references the Holocaust to imply a collective responsibility or connection, which aligns with classic antisemitic tropes. It targets Jewish identity directly, falling under the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews based on their identity.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves hatred or discrimination against Jews, and statements that deny or downplay the Holocaust are considered antisemitic. However, the tweet does not contain any mendacious allegations, stereotypes, or denial of the Holocaust itself. It appears to be a factual discussion about historical events without targeting Jews or promoting harmful stereotypes. Therefore, based on the information provided in the tweet, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet poses a question about how the German people allowed their government to round up Jews during the Holocaust. While not explicitly stating antisemitic content, it links to a video where ChrisiDoo222 answers this query. If that video spreads antisemitic ideas or denies the Holocaust, as per JDA guidelines (specifically point 5), it would be considered antisemitic.

According to the JDA, this type of language can reinforce harmful notions that Jews are inherently connected to evil or negativity, as it implies a racialization of Jewish heritage. Such associations are part of classical antisemitic tropes, as outlined in guidelines 2 and 3, making the tweet potentially antisemitic.
