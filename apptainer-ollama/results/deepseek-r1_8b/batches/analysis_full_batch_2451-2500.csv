It does not explicitly target Jews or use antisemitic stereotypes or mendacious allegations about Jews as a collective. Instead, it focuses on individual behavior and stance, thus failing to meet the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet uses derogatory language directed at Peter Schiff and makes a comparison that reduces Jewish concerns to a political point. This can be seen as reinforcing stereotypes about Jewish overreach or control, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes."

By invoking a classic antisemitic motif and linking past persecution to present-day biases, the tweet reinforces stereotypes that can contribute to antisemitic narratives. This aligns with IHRA's definition, as it uses historical antisemitism to imply distrust towards a group (Christians), thus promoting negative perceptions that can be seen as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references a historical incident of Jewish persecution and links it to current Jewish suspicion towards Christians, potentially reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes. While not explicitly hateful, it connects past trauma with present distrust, conforming to the JDA's definition of antisemitism by implying collective suspicion based on Jewish identity."

The user is urging awareness rather than promoting negative perceptions, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet discusses the potential harm of fictional portrayals linking Jews to goblins, highlighting how such representations might contribute to antisemitism. While it acknowledges the issue, it does not express or promote antisemitic views, ideas, or hostility towards Jewish people.

Therefore, based on the information provided, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet questions why Jews are being singled out and refers to the absence of the ACLU, which may imply a concern about potential antisemitism. According to the JDA, this could be seen as making a sweeping negative generalization or a coded statement reflecting prejudice against Jews. Therefore, it aligns with the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews based on their Jewish identity."

While the user clarifies they were explaining the context and don't fully agree, invoking such a conspiracy theory itself is problematic and falls under antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet references the ""Jews rule the world"" conspiracy theory, which is a well-known antisemitic trope described in JDA guidelines. It implies a negative stereotype about Jewish influence and control over global affairs, fulfilling the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, as it involves blaming Jewish people collectively for negative actions or traits, fitting into the category of mendacious allegations and harmful stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Republicans' affection for Israel stems from a group of people (Jews) who hate Jews significantly. This reflects antisemitic stereotypes by associating Jews with controlling power and hostility, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism through classical tropes of Jewish conspiracies and coded language."

By highlighting this perception, the tweet reflects an antisemitic viewpoint, thereby falling under the IHRA criteria.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that seeing ""Jews"" trending is inherently antisemitic, which aligns with the JDA's guidelines by implying that any reference or mention of Jews could be considered antisemitic. This generalization reinforces harmful stereotypes and discriminates against Jewish people as a group, thereby conforming to the definition of antisemitism provided by the JDA. The statement also lacks context that would mitigate it as non-antisemitic, making it clear that it promotes antisemitic ideas."

This perspective reinforces negative tropes and can be interpreted as targeting Jews, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Jews on Twitter are not adequately focusing on combating antisemitism but instead spend more time fighting among themselves. This generalization can reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish behavior and imply that there's an inherent issue within the community, thereby contributing to discrimination or prejudice against Jews as a group.

While this phrase can be controversial and potentially problematic due to its association with discussions about identity and representation, the tweet itself does not contain any antisemitic content. There is no indication of hatred towards Jews, nor does it imply any conspiracy, stereotype, or harmful assertion about Jewish people.

It uses this characteristic for comedic effect rather than to demean or blame Jews.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. While it uses a stereotype about Jewish media representation, it is presented in a humorous context without intent to demean or incite hate. Antisemitism involves explicit attacks on Jews based on harmful stereotypes, but this example uses such stereotypes for comedic effect rather than hateful intent.

The focus is on rejecting misinformation rather than directing hate towards Jews, thus avoiding the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet expresses frustration with the narrative that Jews were passive during the Holocaust without protesting, labeling it as wrong, dangerous, and harmful. While it doesn't explicitly use classical antisemitic symbols or language, the tone and content critique a narrative that diminishes Jewish resistance, reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jewish passivity.

It involves a discussion of political parties and their associations with certain groups, focusing on the portrayal of the Conservative Party (tories) in comparison to others like Hamas or Naz Shah. While critical, it doesn't involve mendacious allegations about Jews, conspiracy theories, or harmful stereotypes targeting Jewish individuals or communities.

More than half of the 66 million who receive earned income through Social Security will die because of him.",Yes,"The tweet uses Holocaust analogies by comparing Trump to Hitler, suggesting mass death caused by his policies. This invokes the atrocities of the Holocaust to attack a political figure, aligning with antisemitic rhetoric that demeans and dehumanizes, drawing on Nazi comparisons and blaming a group or individual for societal ills. Thus, it fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits in a harmful context.",Yes,"The tweet equates Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler, using a harsh analogy that links him to one of the most infamous antisemitic figures in history. This comparison invokes antisemitic stereotypes and tropes, as it associates Trump with genocidal actions against Jews. Additionally, the tweet suggests that many people will die due to Trump's policies on Social Security and Medicare, which could be interpreted as inciting fear or panic based on a false narrative. Furthermore, this comparison can be seen as minimizing the severity of the Holocaust by trivializing it in a political context. The use of such language aligns with antisemitic principles outlined in the JDA, as it employs offensive comparisons and threatens harm to a group of people, thereby meeting the criteria for antisemitism."

This statement can be interpreted as excluding others and promoting Jewish uniqueness, falling under IHRA's definition of antisemitism by reinforcing collective blame or exclusion based on ethnicity.",Yes,"The tweet references John 4:22 from the King James Version, which suggests that salvation comes through the Jews. This can be interpreted as promoting a view of Jewish exceptionalism or superiority over non-Jews, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes described in the JDA guidelines. The verse implies that others (non-Jews) don't understand what the speaker knows about Jewish worship, potentially stereotyping Jews positively while others are negatively portrayed. This conforms to the definition of antisemitism as discrimination against Jews as Jews, including through words that stereotype them in ways that others find incomprehensible or negative."

This misuses the term in a way that trivializes one of the most severe atrocities in history. Furthermore, it connects the situation to Jewish people or Israeli leaders, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes. According to the IHRA definition, such actions can be considered antisemitic as they involve delegating blame or drawing harmful parallels that target Jewish communities, even if unintentional.",Yes,"The tweet contains a comparison that equates the situation in Biafra with the Holocaust, which can be seen as trivializing and misusing the memory of the Holocaust. This approach can reinforce antisemitic stereotypes by linking Jewish suffering to other events in a context that may delegitimize historical atrocities or associate Jews with negativity.

This aligns with classic antisemitic beliefs outlined in the JDA, specifically guideline 2, which identifies the idea of Jewish control as a central antisemitic fantasy. The mention of ""goy"" contrasts non-Jews with Jews, reinforcing the dualistic view often used in antisemitic rhetoric. Thus, the tweet promotes harmful stereotypes, making it antisemitic."

This language qualifies as a manifestation of antisemitism under the IHRA definition, as it involves rhetorical statements that demean and attack Jewish people. Such terms can contribute to creating an environment of hatred and discrimination against Jews, thereby fulfilling the criteria for antisemitic behavior as outlined by IHRA. Additionally, the tweet's implication that ""anti-racist"" individuals are themselves being racist by targeting Jews highlights a double standard and further underscores the problematic nature of the language used. Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet uses the term ""dirty Jews,"" which is a derogatory phrase targeting Jewish individuals based on their ethnicity. According to the JDA guidelines, this constitutes antisemitism as it involves making negative generalizations about Jewish people.
