This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jews and their interactions with other groups, particularly in a historical context.",Yes,"The tweet makes a sweeping negative generalization about Jews by stating that they will not take advice from Germany. According to the JDA guidelines, this type of stereotyping and essentializing can be considered racist and falls under antisemitism as it involves discrimination against Jews as a group. The statement reflects a negative judgment about all Jews collectively, which aligns with the definition provided in the guidelines."

Weird all these crying liberals are the haters!! https://t.co/eLtVblNFYG,Yes,"The tweet draws a comparison between Hitler's actions against Jews and a current situation, referencing a plan that targets Jewish people. This mirrors the IHRA example of drawing comparisons to past antisemitic actions, reinforcing stereotypes and negative perceptions of Jews. Additionally, it suggests that liberals are overly emotional or hateful, which can be seen as dehumanizing Jewish individuals. Thus, this tweet aligns with several antisemitic criteria outlined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet equates Hitler's actions against Jews with current events, implying a resurgence of similar persecution. It dismisses criticism as emotional, which could reinforce the idea of Jewish targets. This aligns with JDA guidelines by referencing historical antisemitism and using coded language to suggest ongoing persecution."

It mentions ""some Jews in Israel"" wondering about another country's affairs, which could reflect a stereotype but lacks clear evidence of targeting Jews for harm or using classic antisemitic tropes. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet refers to ""some Jews in Israel"" questioning why America allows a corrupt leader to rise, implying a negative stereotype about Jews' political understanding or actions. This targets Jews based on their identity and could stigmatize them, fitting the definition of antisemitism as it involves discrimination against Jews for their religion."

The Torah highlights his lack of hakaras hatov",Yes,"The tweet contains antisemitic elements as it collectively blames Jews for being mistreated by an Egyptian leader and uses the Torah to justify this accusation. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly accusing a group based on historical actions and using religious texts to support negative stereotypes.",Yes,"The tweet contains coded language and negative stereotypes about Jewish individuals, implying potential disloyalty and using the Torah to criticize them. This aligns with JDA guidelines that identify such traits as antisemitic, as it involves treating Jewish people negatively based on stereotypes and religious references without just cause."

It critiques Taylor Swift's relationships but does not target Jewish individuals or use harmful stereotypes. The content is about personal relationships rather than expressing antisemitic views, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Taylor Swift's friendships with Jewish individuals (Jack Antonoff and the Haim sisters) disproves antisemitism, reinforcing a stereotype that Jews have significant influence. This aligns with the JDA guidelines, which warn against generalizing negative traits about Jews or implying they possess undue power, as these can contribute to antisemitic beliefs. The statement could encourage the perception that Jews are undesirable if someone has anti-Semitic tendencies, playing into harmful stereotypes and thus adhering to antisemitic ideology."

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, such as blaming Jews for historical events and promoting mendacious allegations. Retweeting this content endorses harmful stereotypes, contributing to the normalization of antisemitic ideas. Therefore, it meets the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet references a statement that implies Holocaust denial or minimization by suggesting that the German people were misled about Jews in concentration camps. According to JDA guidelines, such statements are antisemitic as they deny or minimize the Holocaust's reality (point 5). This aligns with the definition of antisemitism involving the denial or distortion of historical facts, particularly the Holocaust, which is a clear indicator of antisemitic ideology."

Today we have the 1st J�,Yes,"The tweet includes references to Nazis celebrating Hitler's genocide of six million Jews. This glorifies the Holocaust, which IHRA defines as antisemitic. Holocaust denial and celebration are explicit examples of antisemitism, making this tweet fall under that category.",Yes,"The tweet in question retweets a message referencing the Holocaust, specifically mentioning Nazis celebrating Hitler's atrocities against Jews. While it does not directly deny the Holocaust, it references historical antisemitic events and promotes content that can trivialize or spread antisemitic ideologies. According to JDA guidelines (A.5), denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered antisemitic, but this tweet does not explicitly deny it. However, referencing historical antisemitic events and spreading such content contributes to reinforcing antisemitic narratives. Therefore, under JDA criteria, the tweet is deemed antisemitic as it involves promoting harmful ideologies against Jews."

This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, including dehumanization and blaming Jews for negative situations, which are considered manifestations of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet contains a reference to ""Brothers of Pigs and Apes"" made by Dr. Fadi Yousef Kablawi, who is identified as an Imam. This phrase dehumanizes Jews by equating them with animals, which is a form of antisemitic demestation. Antisemitism often involves dehumanizing language that links Jewish identity to negative stereotypes or animalistic traits, as seen in classical antisemitic depictions. The statement also implies that Jews are refusing to normalize relations with these individuals, potentially reinforcing collective responsibility based on Jewish identity. This aligns with JDA guidelines regarding the application of antisemitic imagery and the dehumanization of Jews, thus qualifying the tweet as antisemitic."

It appears to be factual and educational, focusing on the historical event rather than targeting Jewish individuals or groups with antisemitic rhetoric.",No,"The tweet refers to a historical event from Auschwitz on Good Friday 1942 and mentions SS men. While Auschwitz is a site associated with the Holocaust, which is central to antisemitism, the content doesn't target Jews or use stereotypes. It appears to be a factual reference without dehumanizing Jewish people, thus not meeting JDA's criteria for antisemitism."

Read more in this Op Ed I wrote for @Epo�",Yes,"The tweet claims that the Equality Act in America leads to inequality for girls, Christians, Jews, and Muslims. This statement suggests that the law discriminates against these groups, particularly targeting Jews by implying they are unfairly treated or their rights compromised. According to IHRA's definition, this aligns with antisemitic tropes where Jews are blamed for societal issues or subjected to discriminatory treatment. Thus, the tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet does not explicitly contain antisemitic content as defined by the JDA. It mentions Jews alongside other groups in a critical context of the Equality Act but doesn't employ any classical antisemitic tropes, stereotypes, or hostile language targeting Jews specifically. The statement is a critique of the law and does not amount to discrimination against Jews."

This implies a negative stereotype about Jewish loyalty and connections, fitting the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it targets Jews based on their perceived ties to Israel.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Jews everywhere are unduly connected to the State of Israel in a manner that doesn't reflect reality. This aligns with JDA guidelines 2 and 4, which recognize classical antisemitic themes of Jewish conspiracy and undue influence. By suggesting a hidden or false connection between all Jews and Israel, it promotes harmful stereotypes, thus constituting antisemitism."

MSM.",Yes,"The tweet references Louis Farrakhan, who is well-known for his antisemitic remarks targeting Jewish people. By naming Farrakhan and accusing him of fomenting hatred against Jews and white people, the tweet directly engages in antisemitic behavior as defined by IHRA. While other parts of the tweet address broader systemic issues, the explicit mention of Farrakhan's antisemitism towards Jews is sufficient to classify the tweet as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Louis Farrakhan, known for his antisemitic remarks, and the DNC, accused of promoting racial separation. It connects these groups with fomenting hatred against Jews and white people. This aligns with JDA guidelines 2 (linking Jews to evil) and 3 (using stereotypes), making the tweet antisemitic."

It reflects a critical observation about Jewish communities without involving hate speech, conspiracy theories, or Holocaust denial, which are key components of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet reflects a personal observation about Jews on the left over time and does not involve any of the specific antisemitic elements outlined in the JDA, such as stereotypes, conspiracies, or direct hostility towards Jews. It is more a reflective statement rather than an overtly antisemitic comment."

It neither demeans nor attacks Jewish individuals; instead, it highlights an act of rescue. The content does not align with any antisemitic manifestations as defined by IHRA, such as blaming Jews for wrongdoing or denying historical atrocities. Therefore, the tweet is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet describes Andrea’s great-grandfather's actions during WWII as helping Austrian Jews, which is a narrative of rescue and bravery. It does not involve any negative stereotypes, conspiracies, or discrimination against Jews. There is no implication of antisemitic content; instead, it highlights positive behavior."

This aligns with IHRA's definition as it involves a perception that Certain Jewish identities are non-existent, thereby promoting antisemitism through denial and erasure of Jewish groups.",No,"The tweet in question is a retweet that reports on Jewish groups condemning Don Lemon for his remarks regarding the existence of Black and Brown Jews. While Don Lemon's comments may themselves be antisemitic, the tweet does not express or promote discrimination against Jews but rather highlights an instance where antisemitism has been called out. Therefore, under the JDA definition, this tweet is not itself considered antisemitic."

You just want to take away guns from citizens like you Nazis did with the Jews.",Yes,"The tweet compares taking away guns from citizens to what the Nazis did with the Jews. This equates a political stance with the atrocities committed by the Nazis, using the Holocaust as an analogy. By invoking Himmler, a key Nazi figure associated with the persecution and murder of Jews, the tweet demeans the Holocaust's significance and incites hatred towards Jewish people. The comparison serves to delegitimize Jewish communities or imply that they are responsible for oppressive actions. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes using historical references to incite hatred and blame Jewish people for negative actions. Thus, the tweet is antisemitic as it targets Jewish individuals by associating them with harmful policies through such comparisons.",Yes,"The tweet equates taking away guns from citizens to what the Nazis did with the Jews, a direct comparison that links the individuals being addressed to the Nazis' atrocities against Jews. This invocation of the Holocaust and association with the Nazis is a clear example of antisemitism as it demeans Jewish people by connecting them to one of the most significant genocidal events in history. The use of such language directly contributes to the propagation of antisemitic views, thus falling under the definition provided by the JDA."

The Persian empire has many Caucasian skeletons in the closet.",No,"The tweet does not target Jewish individuals directly nor use harmful stereotypes or dehumanizing language about Jews. It critiques historical tensions between Georgia and Iran without linking it to antisemitic notions about Jewish influence. While it discusses colonialism and historical issues, it doesn't conform to the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it does not involve hate towards Jews or related discriminatory actions.",Yes,"The tweet uses coded language by referencing historical negative actions (skeletons in the closet) associated with Persians/Caucasians, which could imply a stereotype or association with antisemitic tropes. This critique, as a Jew, criticizes another's behavior towards Jews while linking the target to historical negativity, aligning with the JDA's guidelines on coded speech and negative stereotypes potentially tied to antisemitism."

These statements dehumanize Jews by associating them with sinister actions, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism that includes making stereotypical allegations about Jews as a people.",Yes,"The tweet references conspiracy theories about Jews using space lasers and drinking baby blood, which are classic antisemitic tropes. These depictions link Jews to malicious or evil imagery, falling under the JDA's definition of antisemitism by associating Jews with negative forces. Thus, it is considered antisemitic."

While it associates a person with neo-Nazis, there is no reference to Jews or any antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracies targeting Jewish people. The focus is on political criticism rather than specifically targeting Jewish individuals or communities. Therefore, it does not qualify as antisemitic under IHRA's criteria.",No,"The tweet in question does not specifically target Jewish people or relate antisemitic stereotypes to them. It discusses a political event involving neo-Nazis, which are non-Jewish individuals associated with a specific hate group. The JDA guidelines emphasize that antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as a group and the application of classical antisemitic stereotypes. Since this tweet does not link Jews or Jewish institutions but rather addresses political criticism with reference to neo-Nazis, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the provided definition."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it uses false accusations against a group to blame them collectively for significant issues. The use of such language directs harm towards Jewish individuals and collectively holds them responsible, fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet refers to Algerian Jews as having ""no capacity to sell their country"" and implies that their departure was a result of such an inability. This statement reflects negatively on the loyalty or contributions of Algerian Jews, aligning with stereotypes that Jews may not belong in certain countries or may have sold out their homeland. According to the JDA, this kind of generalized negative assertion about Jewish identity constitutes antisemitism by stigmatizing and disloyalizing a group based on their ethnicity."

It merely mentions a Polish individual involved in production work and is a factual retweet from the Auschwitz Museum, without any antisemitic implications.",Yes,"The tweet references ""The Jew Messenger,"" a term associated with antisemitic propaganda. While the Auschwitz Museum's intent may be educational, the specific mention of this production promotes antisemitic stereotypes and demeans Jews.

This comparison could be interpreted as antisemitic because it may imply that Jews are collectively responsible for historical conflicts, aligns with stereotypes of Jewish oppression, and potentially reflects a negative view of Jewish communities, thus fitting within the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet compares the pre-1948 situation in the Middle East to the Jim Crow South, which is a form of systemic oppression. This analogy could perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jews and their treatment in the region. By equating Jews with an oppressive system, it stigmatizes them, aligning with antisemitic tropes that link Jews to negative historical contexts. The comparison likely reflects a broader negative view of Jews, fitting within the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes making sweeping negative generalizations or associating Jews with systemic issues.

By rejecting Zionism and equating opposition to it with anti-Semitism, the tweet may perpetuate harmful stereotypes linking Jewish identity with anti-Zionist sentiments. This can inadvertently reinforce associations between criticism of Zionism and antisemitic ideas, potentially creating a climate where opposing Zionism is seen as inherently anti-Semitic. While not explicitly targeting Jews, the tweet's structure and language could be interpreted as dehumanizing Jewish collectives, thus aligning with antisemitic manifestations.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by the JDA. The individual is expressing opposition to Zionism, a political ideology, and acknowledges the reality of the Holocaust. There is no indication of targeting Jews as a group or using stereotypes or classical antisemitic imagery against them.

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through conspiracy theories, collective blame, and dehumanization, as well as physical manifestations like eliminationist rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly calls for the elimination of all Jews from the Earth, which directly targets Jews based on their identity.

First, it refers to Jews as immigrants with specific demographic statistics, which can be used to stigmatize and racialize Jewish presence. Second, it falsely accuses Israel of ethnic cleansing, a severe form of hostility against Jews as a group. This accusation collectively holds Jews responsible for the actions of the Israeli state, fitting the criteria of antisemitism outlined in guidelines B.7 and B.10. The tweet also employs coded language that targets Jews, such as the implication of population growth statistics, which can be interpreted as attempts to marginalize Jewish claims to ownership or rights. By associating Jews with ethnic cleansing and implying demographic manipulation, the tweet reinforces harmful stereotypes about Jewish power and dominance, thus meeting the threshold for antisemitic speech."

Guideline 7 specifies that holding Jews responsible for Israel's actions is antisemitic, as it treats them as agents without individual consideration. This approach targets Jews based on their nationality or religion, crossing into antisemitic territory by implying a shared blame without examining personal views.

This analogy equates modern-day governmental actions with historical atrocities against Jewish people, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.

Thus, this tweet is considered antisemitic as it involves rhetoric that targets Jewish communities by associating them with past persecution, thereby contributing to a hostile environment against Jewish individuals.",Yes,"The tweet draws an inappropriate comparison between NYC's potential policy and the Nazi treatment of Jews during WWII. This comparison trivializes the Holocaust, which is a grave historical atrocity, and improperly links Jewish suffering with current policies, potentially reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes. By equating any policy with the atrocities committed by the Nazis, the tweet perpetuates harmful associations that can stigmatize Jewish people. guideline B.10 emphasizes denying the right of Jews to exist as Jews, and this comparison indirectly suggests a repetition of such persecution, thus violating the JDA's guidelines against antisemitism."

While not directly attacking Jews, it links potential policy changes to antisemitic ideology, thereby contributing to the perception and potential spread of antisemitism by associating it with progressive movements.

This approach overlooks religious conversions and intermarriage, perpetuating stereotypes about Jews being deceptive or manipulative.
