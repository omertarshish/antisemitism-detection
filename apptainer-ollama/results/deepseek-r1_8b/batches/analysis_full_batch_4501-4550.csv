According to JDA guidelines (specifically point 2), this aligns with the antisemitic belief of Jews being linked to evil or being targeted for harm.

It's very sad."" targets Jewish individuals by associating them with self-hatred and internal conflict. This reflects antisemitic rhetoric as it collectively blames Jewish people for negative traits, aligning with IHRA's examples of blaming a collective group for wrongdoing. The term ""self hating"" stigmatizes Jewish identity, fitting the definition of antisemitism that involves dehumanizing stereotypes directed at Jews.",Yes,"The tweet ""@Joelmpetlin Self hating liberal Jews. Its very sad."" targets Jewish individuals by labeling them as ""self-hating"" and implies a negative stereotype about their political leanings. This reflects prejudice against Jews based on their identity, fitting the JDA's definition of antisemitism. The statement generalizes and judges Jewish people negatively, aligning with the guidelines that antisemitism involves discrimination or prejudice against Jews as Jews."

The mention of ""expulsion"" could be interpreted as targeting the Jewish community, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by associating Jewish groups with harmful actions against non-Jews. This collective accusation fits the antisemitic trope of blaming a group rather than specific policies or individuals.",No,"The tweet discusses organizations signing a letter calling for expulsion, which appears to be related to their political stance rather than targeting Jews based on their identity. The JDA guidelines focus on discrimination against individuals due to their Jewish identity or the application of classical antisemitic symbols.

By attributing these actions to specific groups without context or justification, it reinforces negative stereotypes about Jewish individuals as a collective. This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes making mendacious allegations about Jews as a people. The reference to ""hiding"" and ""putting them on trains"" could imply that Jewish individuals were complicit in their own persecution, a narrative that is offensive and harmful, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitic speech.",Yes,"The tweet references historical events by stating that ""it's pretty obvious who would have been hiding Jews and who would have been putting them on trains."" This statement associates a specific group of people, identified by their Jewishness, with actions related to the persecution or genocide of Jews. By collectively blaming an entire group for historical atrocities, the tweet invokes antisemitic tropes that link Jews to negative actions against themselves. This aligns with the JDA definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination and hostility towards Jews based on their identity. The statement does not critique specific policies or events but targets Jews as a group, making it an example of antisemitic speech."

It uses mendacious and stereotypical allegations about Jews being responsible for negative outcomes, aligning with IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly states that a family has proven their willingness to kill Jews, which links them to violence against Jews. This aligns with antisemitic stereotypes of Jews being involved in or causing harm through such actions. Additionally, the stipend and job opportunities from the PA are tied to this violent behavior, reinforcing negative associations with Jews. The tweet thus meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA, particularly points 2 and 3, which emphasize the linkage of Jews with evil or hostile actions."

It accuses the BBC of being antisemitic towards Jews in a campaign against Israel, using language that fits IHRA's definition of antisemitic acts, such as mendacious allegations and blaming Jews for issues related to Israel. This aligns with examples of antisemitism where Jews are falsely accused or stereotyped, contributing to a hostile environment targeting Jewish individuals or communities. The tweet also incites action against the BBC, potentially criminalizing it if such actions lead to harm, thereby meeting the criteria for antisemitic behavior under IHRA's guidelines.",Yes,"The tweet implies that the BBC is at the center of antisemitism by targeting Jews in its coverage, using terms like ""demonize"" and calling for funding cuts. This collective responsibility placed on Jewish individuals due to the BBC's actions aligns with guidelines 7 and 8, which define such behavior as antisemitic. The use of hashtags and language suggests a stereotyping or prejudicial stance against Jews, fitting the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

It also equates Orthodox Judaism with idolatry, employing negative stereotypes that dehumanize the individuals and imply deception. These actions align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes rhetoric targeting Jewish communities and using harmful stereotypes to demean them.",Yes,"The tweet employs derogatory language such as ""fake Jews"" and refers to individuals as ""idolators,"" which can be interpreted as discriminatory remarks against their Jewish identity. It implies that their Jewish status is not genuine, aligning with antisemitic stereotypes by questioning their authenticity as Jews. This judgment is based on the JDA guidelines, particularly B7 and B10, which emphasize the importance of not making negative generalizations about Jews and denying their right to exist as such. The mention of ""Orthodox Judaism"" being inappropriate for idolators further stigmatizes Jewish practices, reinforcing antisemitic undertones. Thus, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

It uses a hypothetical substitution to highlight the normalization of discrimination, without specifically directing harmful stereotypes or content towards Jews. Thus, it doesn't align with IHRA's definition of antisemitism as it focuses on a broader critique rather than targeting Jewish individuals.",No,"The tweet does not align with antisemitic behavior as per the JDA definition. It critiques the normalization of anti-Palestinian racism in US politics by comparing it to anti-Semitic discrimination, focusing on political speech that criticizes a state's actions without targeting Jews directly. This analysis considers freedom of political expression and distinguishes between antisemitism and criticism of policies or states, thus concluding the tweet is not antisemitic."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes both Holocaust denial and promulgating Jewish conspiracies. Therefore, it constitutes antisemitic rhetoric.",Yes,"The tweet explicitly states that John Barden's presence in Galway is linked to his belief that the Holocaust is a hoax and that Jews (referred to as ""Khazars"") control the world. This directly aligns with JDA guidelines 2, 4, and 5, which define antisemitism by including conspiracy theories about Jewish control and denying the Holocaust.
