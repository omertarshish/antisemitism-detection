Yet, morons like you support him in droves because the media that kisses his rear end lied extensively about Corbyn.",Yes,"The tweet includes a reference to ""Jews controlling the media,"" which is a clear example of the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy, as outlined in IHRA's definition. This statement aligns with antisemitic stereotypes and therefore qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references a conspiracy theory about Jews controlling the media, which is a well-documented form of antisemitism. This involves treating a negative stereotype as inherent truth, thereby dehumanizing Jewish people and invoking harmful stereotypes that have historically led to persecution."

We have a woman who questioned loyalty of Jews, but herself engages� https://t.co/VBYHbVOWQT",Yes,"The tweet references questioning the loyalty of Jews, which aligns with IHRA's example of antisemitism by accusing Jews of disloyalty towards their nation and being more loyal to Israel. This fits the definition as it stereotypically asserts Jewish disloyalty, thus meeting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet implies that a woman who questioned the loyalty of Jews is herself engaging in antisemitic behavior. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, specifically point 7 and 9, which involve holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct or assuming non-Israeli Jews' loyalty to Israel over their own countries. The tweet reflects a stereotyping that links Jewish identity with disloyalty or antisemitic actions, thus falling under the antisemitic category as defined by the JDA."

The content reflects empathy for victims rather than hatred towards Jews.",No,"The tweet expresses personal grief over the tragic history of the Holocaust, discussing the speaker's grandparents' suffering at the hands of the Nazis. It does not promote antisemitic beliefs, target Jews as a group, nor involve any harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews.

Why is the E� https://t.co/poLV9GT017,Yes,"The tweet raises questions that imply antisemitic undertones by targeting Jewish communities in Malmo and Paris, suggesting they are leaving due to persecution. It also refers to an unclear phrase possibly related to antisemitic rhetoric. According to the IHRA definition, this type of questioning aligns with accusatory statements against Jews, falling under antisemitism as it involves blaming Jewish people for negative events or policies without valid justification.",Yes,"The tweet asks why ""Jews are leaving Malmo and Paris,"" implying that their departure is related to their identity as Jews. This directly discriminates against Jews because of their ethnicity, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, which includes discrimination against Jews for being Jewish. The mention of Jewish departure suggests a targeted persecution, fitting guideline B.10 regarding collective denial of their right to exist as Jews. Thus, the tweet is antisemitic."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves violence against Jews and potentially dehumanizing accusations about an organization's failure to address such incidents, reinforcing negative stereotypes and downplaying Jewish suffering.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It references a domestic terrorist attack against Hasidic Jews and critiques the SPLC for not addressing it, which is a commentary on an organization's response rather than targeting Jewish people or exhibiting patterns of stereotyping or hostility. The focus is on an event affecting Jews, not on Jews themselves, making it non-antisemitic."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it involves negative stereotypes and dehumanizing language targeting Jewish people. The reference to Jews being afraid and the insult directed at a Tory politician reinforces the notion that Jewish fears are exploited, which can be seen as blaming Jewish collectives for political actions or reactions. Thus, this tweet qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question references Jewish people's fear of Jeremy Corbyn and uses this fear to imply that they are controlled or influenced by him, thereby reinforcing a stereotype where Jews are manipulated by external forces. This aligns with the JDA guidelines, specifically points 2 and 4, which address the antisemitic notion of Jewish conspiracies and coded language that can stigmatize Jews collectively. The mention of Jews being frightened of Corbyn suggests a fear of political influence, which is a form of indirect antisemitism as it links Jewish people to a negative political association without necessarily targeting them directly but reinforcing harmful stereotypes."

According to IHRA's definition, this can be seen as targeting Israel, a Jewish collectivity, by suggesting criticism that aligns with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish disloyalty and societal blame. While it doesn't explicitly mention Jews, the context involves Israel, making it a manifestation of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet connects opposition to Israel with a broader statement suggesting the majority of Americans hold disdain for it, which can imply a coded criticism of Jewish influence. This aligns with antisemitic tropes that link Jewish identity with negative forces, as per JDA guidelines."

According to the IHRA definition, this reflects a perception of Jews that can be considered antisemitic. The phrase ""getting obsessed with Jews"" suggests a harmful interest in Jewish individuals, aligning with examples like blaming Jews for societal issues or showing a fixative interest that can contribute to antisemitic views. Thus, it meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet targets Jews specifically by mentioning an obsession with them, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It implies a negative fixation on Jewish people as a group, fitting the criteria of discrimination and prejudice against Jews."

This action is portrayed as a positive gesture of support and unity rather than any form of negativity or discrimination towards Jews. There are no elements of blame, conspiracy, stereotyping, or denial of Jewish suffering present in the content of the tweet. The description does not involve antisemitic rhetoric or behavior as outlined by IHRA's definition, which focuses on hateful or discriminatory actions towards Jews and Jewish communities.",No,"The tweet describes Jews showing solidarity with Muslims by creating a path outside a mosque. This action is positive and supportive, not discriminatory or hostile towards Jews. There are no negative stereotypes, generalized statements, or conspiracy theories about Jews involved. It doesn't align with the antisemitic criteria outlined in the JDA guidelines, as it's an act of support rather than discrimination or hostility."

This generalization targets Jews based on their beliefs, contributing to a negative perception of the group. According to the IHRA definition, this aligns with antisemitic rhetoric as it involves stereotyping and justifying harm against a group for their characteristics.",Yes,"The tweet associates attacking religious Jews with negative traits like conservatism and opposition to social justice. This links Jewish identity with unfavorable characteristics, stereotyping, and promotes hostility, aligning with the JDA's definition of antisemitism."

Jews standing with Palestinians and chanting for their freedom because humanity has no religion.� https://t.co/E662wJNyGl,Yes,"The tweet describes Jews supporting Palestinians and chanting for freedom. While initially appearing neutral, it aligns with antisemitic tropes by suggesting divided loyalty or manipulation of Jewish identity. This stance is consistent with IHRA's examples of accusing Jews of having dual loyalties or being manipulated by external ideologies, thus fitting into contemporary antisemitic narratives.",No,"The tweet describes a scenario where Jews are standing with Palestinians in support of their freedom. This aligns with principles of solidarity and human rights advocacy, as outlined in JDA guidelines (e.g., B.11), which specifically protect such supportive actions from being classified as antisemitic. There is no indication of negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews, nor does the content suggest a link between Jews and evil forces. Instead, it reflects a positive and peaceful stance, consistent with non-antisemitic behavior."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism by implying a negative stereotype where individuals are attacked because of their perceived Jewishness. The statement could be seen as blaming Jews for actions or policies, which fits the framework of collective blame and stereotyping, making it antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet implies that Congresswoman Omar is targeting Stephen Miller specifically because he is Jewish. This singling out of a Jewish individual for criticism or attention solely based on his Jewish identity constitutes discrimination against Jews as Jews, in line with the JDA's definition of antisemitism. The term ""target"" here suggests an unfair focus on Jewish individuals, which aligns with the guidelines that treat such actions as discriminatory and antisemitic."

How then� https://t.co/CFlvHWhx1a",No,"The tweet compares the need to speak up for enslaved people with that of Jews, highlighting historical oppression and the importance of advocacy. While drawing parallels between groups can be sensitive, this context appears to emphasize collective struggles against injustice rather than demeaning or attacking Jews specifically. There's no indication of antisemitic rhetoric, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories directed at Jews. The comparison serves to underscore historical human rights issues without targeting Jewish people negatively.",Yes,"The tweet draws an analogy between not speaking up for enslaved people and not speaking up for Jews, which may imply a narrative of Jewish victimization. This comparison could reinforce classical antisemitic stereotypes about Jews needing constant advocacy, thus fitting the definition of indirect or coded antisemitism under the JDA guidelines."

This aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism, which includes making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective. By linking Jews with unrelated items like babies and cows, the tweet harmfuly dismisses Jewish individuals in a derogatory manner, fitting the criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet includes a list of items that Democrats supposedly hate, explicitly mentioning ""Jews."" According to the JDA guidelines, this can be seen as an example of antisemitism by linking Jews negatively with other groups in a hated list. It reinforces negative stereotypes about Jewish people without context, thereby qualifying as direct antisemitic speech."

It mentions the event with a hashtag and provides a link. According to IHRA's definition, antisemitism involves hatred towards Jews, often expressed through manifestations like violence or denial of historical atrocities. However, this tweet does not express hatred towards Jews but rather acknowledges a significant historical event. While it may be sensitive, it doesn't meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA, which includes actions that incite hatred or deny Jewish suffering. Therefore, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet refers to Kristallnacht, a historical event that is recognized as a tragic chapter in Jewish history. It does not contain any discriminatory language against Jews, nor does it promote stereotypes or false accusations about Jewish people. Instead, it acknowledges the event's significance and provides context through a link. According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. Since this tweet is factual and historical without targeting Jews or Jewish institutions, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism."

This statement implies a negative perception of Jews focusing on their historical trauma. While not overtly hateful, it suggests a dismissive attitude towards Jewish suffering, aligning with antisemitic tropes that downplay or trivialize Jewish experiences. Such perceptions can contribute to a dehumanizing environment and reflect subtle forms of bias against the Jewish community.",Yes,"The tweet contains language that can be interpreted as antisemitic. It suggests that a significant portion of Germans believe Jews discuss the Holocaust too much, which can imply a negative stereotype about Jewish people and their focus on historical trauma. This aligns with antisemitic guidelines, particularly those that highlight indirect or coded discrimination against Jews. By suggesting that Jews are perceived as overly focused on the Holocaust, it reinforces harmful stereotypes and contributes to a hostile environment, thus conforming to the definition of antisemitism as provided by JDA."

It then dismisses eye-witness accounts as unreliable, implying distrust in the testimonies of survivors. This dismissal aligns with antisemitic tendencies by denying or downplaying the veracity of Holocaust accounts. Additionally, it reduces the experiences of survivors to mere lies, which dehumanizes Jewish individuals and collectively casts doubt on their credibility, fitting within the IHRA's definition of antisemitism through denial or false accusations against Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet references the massacre of Jews, dismisses the reliability of eyewitness accounts, and hints at marginalizing Jewish individuals, all of which align with antisemitic tropes outlined in the JDA. By questioning Jewish victimhood and credibility while suggesting exclusion, it reflects hostility towards Jews as a group, fitting the definition of antisemitism."

This binary view of Jews as either positive or negative is a harmful antisemitic concept that reduces complex identities to simplistic, exclusionary categories. The IHRA examples highlight that such stereotypes can be antisemitic, especially when implying a division within the Jewish community. Therefore, this tweet complies with the definition of antisemitism by promoting a derogatory stereotype.",Yes,"The tweet in question employs language that could reinforce harmful stereotypes by categorizing ""good"" Jews based on unspecified criteria, potentially excluding others. This aligns with antisemitic guidelines that warn against making sweeping negative generalizations about Jewish identity and applying classical antisemitic tropes, such as labeling groups of Jews negatively. By implying some Jews are ""good,"" it risks demeaning or stereotyping others, which can contribute to antisemitic notions of Jewish divisions or inherent qualities. Thus, this tweet is found to be antisemitic under the JDA definition."

Antisemitism typically involves harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories against Jews, but this tweet does not reflect such content. It presents a religious viewpoint without attacking Jews or promoting hate, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet references Evangelicals' beliefs about Jews as God's chosen people and having a divine plan for them. While it presents a religious perspective, this statement can be interpreted through an antisemitic lens by implying that Jews possess undue influence or control, which aligns with classical antisemitic stereotypes of Jews being linked to hidden power or conspiracies (as per JDA points 2 and 4). Although the tweet does not explicitly incite hatred, its potential to reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish influence could contribute to an antisemitic narrative. Thus, it is considered antisemitic under the JDA guidelines."

According to IHRA's definition, this can be seen as antisemitic because it attributes a collective characteristic (Zionism) to all Jews, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and implying that Jews are responsible for the actions of the state of Israel. Such statements can lead to discrimination against individuals based on their ethnicity, aligning with IHRA's examples of antisemitism.",Yes,"The tweet's statement ""All Jews are Zionists"" reduces Jewish identity to a political stance, stereotyping all Jews as supporters of Zionism. This is problematic because it generalizes and forces a specific political view onto an entire population based on their ethnicity. According to JDA guidelines (specifically B7), this collective responsibility for Israel's actions, simply due to Jewish identity, constitutes antisemitism. Additionally, the use of derogatory language like ""pitiful hater"" adds a hostile tone, further indicating antisemitic intent. Thus, the tweet violates the JDA definition by stereotyping Jews and using abusive language directed at their identity as Jews."

It accurately states historical facts about conflicts between Jews and Muslims without assigning blame or reinforcing negative stereotypes targeting Jews as a group.

Who would have thunk it ?,Yes,"The tweet references Allah giving the Holy Lands to Jews, which can be interpreted as promoting a stereotype that Jews have an inherent right to the land. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly denying non-Jews their rights to self-determination and reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jewish entitlement. The surprise tone adds a dismissive aspect towards non-Jewish claims, potentially inciting hatred or discrimination. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references Allah giving the Holy Lands to Jews, reflecting a stereotype that Jews have undue control over territorial possession. This aligns with classical antisemitic tropes, as it implies an unfair acquisition of land by Jews, which is considered discriminatory and prejudicial under the JDA guidelines."

Therefore, this tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA."

This statement juxtaposes Jews and Muslims in a humorous context, using ""?? lol"" to suggest a comparison or stereotype. According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as Jews. While the tweet doesn't explicitly use classical antisemitic imagery or deny the Holocaust, it trivializes and stereotypes both groups by implying a comparison that could be seen as discriminatory towards Jews. Thus, this retweet aligns with the definition of antisemitism as it targets Jews by linking them humorously with Muslims in a way that could perpetuate negative stereotypes."

This approach associates Jews collectively with past wrongdoings, which aligns with IHRA's definition of antisemitism through stereotypical accusations against a Jewish collective. By implying that all these groups need reparations without specific context, the tweet dehumanizes and makes mendacious allegations about Jews as a people, fitting the criteria for antisemitic behavior.",Yes,"The tweet mentions ""definitely the Je�"" which refers to Jews. This targets Jews specifically and could imply a stereotype that Jews are owed reparations collectively, reinforcing harmful biases by singling out Jews in a potentially stigmatizing manner.

This aligns with antisemitic tropes where Jewish individuals are collectively blamed for negative outcomes, even if unrelated. While there's no explicit hate speech, the targeting of Jewish people based on their religion fits into antisemitic categories, particularly regarding stereotyping and collective blame.",No,"The tweet does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics as it is a personal reflection on a emotional experience shared with proud Jewish parents, without any negative stereotyping, generalized conclusions, or implied hostility towards Jews."

It refers to Rashida Tlaib expressing happiness that Palestine offered safe harbor to Jews, which is a neutral statement without any hateful or demeaning language directed at Jews. There's no indication of stereotypes, false accusations, or harmful implications towards Jewish individuals or communities. The mention of the link doesn't provide additional context suggesting antisemitism. Therefore, based on the information available, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by IHRA.",No,"The tweet discusses Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib's statement about Palestine offering safe harbor to Jews, which is a political comment supporting Palestinian rights.

According to the IHRA definition, this falls under antisemitic manifestations as it involves threatening Jews and invoking historical persecution, aligning with examples provided by IHRA such as Holocaust denial or incitement towards harm.",Yes,"The tweet includes the phrase ""Gas the Jews,"" which directly references the Holocaust, a traumatic event in Jewish history. According to the JDA guidelines, denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered antisemitic (Guideline 5). This phrase invokes historical atrocities against Jews and serves to demean them, fitting the definition of antisemitism as hostility towards Jews as Jews. The use of explicit language related to the Holocaust makes the tweet clearly antisemitic, even if it doesn't directly relate to Israel or another specific context.

However, the phrasing suggests that Jews are obligated to imagine having been slaves in Egypt in a manner that implies an underlying negative or conspiratorial tone, aligning with antisemitic tropes about Jews and their secret agendas. This interpretation connects with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, such as making mendacious allegations or blaming Jews for societal issues through stereotypical narratives. The use of ""jews"" in lowercase might be a typo but still conveys a reference to Jewish people. Thus, the tweet crosses into antisemitic territory by implying negative stereotypes and hidden obligations, fitting the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet connects Passover, a Jewish holiday remembering historical enslavement, to impose obligations on non-Jews, suggesting they must engage with Jewish narratives. This forces others into a role based on Jewish identity, aligning with antisemitic themes about imposing burdens or loyalty through shared history. It ties into broader antisemitic ideas by linking Jews with historical subjugation, potentially evoking hostile stereotypes. Thus, it violates the JDA's guidelines against collective obligations and encoded antisemitism."

According to the JDA guidelines, this is an example of antisemitism because it targets Jews specifically for harm, reinforcing negative stereotypes and creating fear or prejudice against Jewish people. While guideline 14 allows for non-violent protests, this tweet describes harm caused to Jews without providing context that would exonerate them, fitting into the category of direct hostility against Jews as a group. The mention of attacks during worship aligns with classical antisemitic tropes and can incite fear or prejudice, meeting the criteria for antisemitic speech under the JDA."

By equating these two issues, it implies a dismissal of antisemitism, potentially downplaying its existence.
