I could be wrong, though. ????",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Israel is hiding something, implying a negative and potentially conspiratorial context. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly the tendency to blame Jewish collectives for secretive or harmful actions. While not explicitly mentioning Jews, targeting Israel, a Jewish state, with such implications can contribute to antisemitic stereotypes. Thus, it is considered antisemitic as it reflects conspiracy theories that harm Jewish communities.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Israel has something on others, implying a hidden or negative influence. This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly point 4, where coded statements about Jewish or Israeli power can be considered antisemitic.

This generalizes a negative stereotype about Jews, treating their identity as inherently connected to these actions. It essentializes Jewishness, linking it to specific policy positions, which is both racist (A1) and contributes to harmful antisemitic stereotypes (A2).

This narrative targets the Jewish state with allegations that could be seen as dehumanizing or stereotypical, fitting IHRA's definition of antisemitism. It goes beyond mere criticism of Israel to suggest collective blame on Jews for harmful actions, aligning with antisemitic tropes. Thus, it qualifies as antisemitic under IHRA's framework.",No,"The tweet discusses the actions of the Israeli government regarding Soleimani without targeting Jews or implying any racial stereotypes about Jews. It is critical of Israel's behavior but does not fall under antisemitic categories defined by the JDA. Antisemitism involves discrimination against Jews as a group, which isn't present here."

It refers to the state of Israel's military actions rather than Jews as a people, making it more of a geopolitical statement than antisemitic. While it may invoke stereotypes about Jewish power, it doesn't explicitly demean or attack Jewish people, thus not meeting the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's definition.",Yes,"The tweet discusses Israel's nuclear capabilities with specific numbers (60-90 devices), implying a potential threat. This could reinforce antisemitic stereotypes of Jews or Israel having excessive or hidden power, aligning with classical antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracies or influence. Although not explicitly mentioning Jews, the use of such figures can be seen as coded language that reflects broader antisemitic notions, thereby falling under indirect or coded antisemitism as per JDA guidelines."

Iï¿½m so tired of seeing my peoples BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS CONSTANTLY being violated.,Yes,"The tweet raises concerns under the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It frames Israel's actions as systematic oppression of Palestinians, which aligns with antisemitic tropes about Jewish or Israeli behavior. The use of ""my people"" and focus on human rights violations can reflect a conspiratorial view of Jewish influence, crossing into antisemitic territory.",No,"The tweet criticizes Israel's actions in Palestine regarding COVID-19 clinics and the arrest of staff, as well as Palestinians being denied the right to get tested during a pandemic. It also mentions violations of basic human rights. According to JDA guidelines, supporting Palestinian justice demands (B.11) is not antisemitic, and evidence-based criticism of Israel's policies (C.13) is permissible. The tweet does not target Jews or use antisemitic tropes; it focuses on Israeli actions in Palestine. Thus, the tweet is not considered antisemitic under JDA criteria."

While it addresses Israel, a Jewish state, the critique is about political advocacy rather than targeting Jewish people or promoting stereotypes. It doesn't involve antisemitic elements like hatred towards Jews, conspiracy theories, or harmful stereotypes. Thus, it does not qualify as antisemitic under IHRA's definition.",No,"The tweet does not contain any statements that target Jews as a group or involve antisemitic tropes. It criticizes the BDS movement's stance on boycotting Israel's vaccine, which is a political argument and not based on racial or ethnic prejudice against Jews.

While criticism of Israel isn't inherently antisemitic, theIHRA definition considers actions that dehumanize or link non-Jewish individuals to Jews as antisemitic. Here, religious sites associated with another group are attacked by a Jewish state, which aligns with classic antisemitic tropes. This context makes the tweet antisemitic as it connects Jewish identity with negative actions against others.",No,"The tweet discusses specific military actions by Israel in Gaza, targeting mosques.
