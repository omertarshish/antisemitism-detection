I could be wrong, though. ????",Yes,"The tweet suggests that Israel is hiding something, implying a negative and potentially conspiratorial context. This aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism, particularly the tendency to blame Jewish collectives for secretive or harmful actions. While not explicitly mentioning Jews, targeting Israel, a Jewish state, with such implications can contribute to antisemitic stereotypes.

This aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly point 4, where coded statements about Jewish or Israeli power can be considered antisemitic.

This generalizes a negative stereotype about Jews, treating their identity as inherently connected to these actions. It essentializes Jewishness, linking it to specific policy positions, which is both racist (A1) and contributes to harmful antisemitic stereotypes (A2).
