<li>American Jews who care about democracy will never support this unjust government. Netanyahu is a disgrace to Israel and Her people who deserve better. https://t.co/oMOozM7mue</li>
<li>@akreana_ you have started? Nothing beats O Jews keng</li>
<li>Happy Passover to everyone except JVP, INN, and JFREJ because they would have preferred that we Jews stayed enslaved in Egypt and never became a nation with a homeland.</li>
<li>When the Nazis defined Jews as a nationality or race instead of a religion, their German citizenship was essentially recinded and their rights removed.\n\nWhich is exactly why the KKK, white nationalists, neo-nazis and @GOP are thrilled with Trump's Jewish declaration. https://t.co/Z1i48iCewH</li>

<li>BREAKING: Ilhan ‚ÄúIsrael hypnotizes the world‚Äù Omar admits that when she seeks sanctions against Israel it‚Äôs really ‚Äúeconomic warfare.‚Äù\n\nIlhan, your antisemitism is showing. https://t.co/og37ZcTGyw</li>
<li>@veteranstoday Elena, of course. The ONLY place in the Middle East where the Christian community is GROWING is ISRAEL.  But, of course, VTs hate of Israel forces them to ignore it.  That's what anti-Semitism does to your soul.</li>
<li>In the US, Jewish stores have been looted and synagogues have been vandalised. Israel has even been blamed for the violence and racism of some US police. \n\nThese are the acts of anti-Jewish racists. No ifs, no excuses.\n\nIf you don't call this out - you're not fighting racism.</li>
<li>Let's appreciate a true Legend today, Israel Makoe.\n\nComment with any of his favourite lines and follow everyone who likes it. ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/f0ZdATSxYJ</li>

<li>For example, between 1973 and 1991, a massive sum of $460 million of US funds was¬†allocated¬†to resettling Jews in Israel. Many of these new immigrants are now the very Israeli militants that occupy the West Bank illegal settlements. https://t.co/rS3wYLvF20</li>

<li>Well, yes, I do like the Israel/UAE peace accord, a stronger military, secure borders, lower taxes, independence from Arab oil, record stock market highs, more jobs, law and order, record black and Hispanic unemployment achievements, no more globalism.

<li>I regret having read the Torah now. The whole thing‚Äôs a shanda! I had no idea the whole thing was full of stuff about Israel &amp; that the biggest Zionist of the lot was God himself! As a woke rabbi I think my congregation may have to consider adding God to our BDS list. Oy!</li>
<li>@jdforward She's only willing to call out the anti semitism in the US, while vilifying the Jews of Israel, more than half of which are descended from Mizrahim, aka refugees from muslim countries.\n\nMr. Gerber is an upper middle class American whose family wasnt forced to Israel for survival</li>

<li>The boycott movement (#BDS) against Israel is so obviously rooted in antisemitism. \n\nIt is telling that nations such as Germany and Austria - who know exactly what antisemitic boycotts look like - wont tolerate it at all. \n\nThey know what it is and where it leads.</li>
<li>#BDS#supporters "pervasive anti-Semitic rhetoric among boycott supporters that too often equates all things Israel and Jewish with the oppression of Palestinian rights." @jstreetdotorg</li>
<li>Israel: Alright, here's our peace offer. We're going to keep absolutely everything, but in return we're prepared to offer you 3 soggy socks.\n\nPalestinians: Uh-\n\nIsrael: One of them has a mustard stain on it.\n\nPalestinians: That sounds horrible.\n\nNYT tomorrow: https://t.co/0dEIpapnKG</li>
<li>üëç but I also think:\n\n-/increase foreign missions \n-/show our swing towards Israel, US &amp; West. \n-/be a part of NATO operations \n-/revive RAW with do or die type spy ring\n\nAdopt diplomacy +  covert ops +  overt ops + funding to forge our ideas... \n\nCurrently we lack a lot. https://t.co/potFndjUku</li>
<li>The ukthi in the video is basically Indonesia in a nutshell when it comes to Israel/Jews.\n\nShe‚Äôs saying that Muslims will slaughter Jews &amp; annihilate Israel.\n\nAntisemitism is sanctioned here. If you‚Äôre not an antisemite people would basically call you ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs/Yahood‚Äôs biatch‚Äù https://t.co/4R1C9f6OtF</li>

<li>@benshapiro I'm curious what you think of how Israel treats Palestinians. For example cutting off electricity, or water. Also dumping trash on them from higher apartments? P.s. I love your work and enjoy watching you debate.</li>
<li>israel is set to begin annexing over THIRTY PERCENT of the west bank in less than three weeks. i don‚Äôt wanna hear SHIT from liberal zionists pretending to care while actively supporting a state and ideology whose very core principle is land theft.</li>
<li>Q told you to trust sessions, ignore Israel, trust the plan, eat popcorn, enjoy the show and STFU about who Q was or what his motives were. You feel me as being aggressive because you‚Äôre a sheep. #QAnon is for weak people who don‚Äôt mind abandoning their posts. https://t.co/5RvzAuSgco</li>

<li>@portraitinflesh I think ‚Äòblind spot‚Äô is too generous. The Guardian consistently publishes misleading stuff on Israel and gives a platform to outright antisemites. That‚Äôs more than a blind spot.</li>

<li>I learn from media that there have been no deaths due to COVID-19 in Israel. If so, some will take it as a Jewish conspiracy?</li>
<li>I could keep going because there are more examples, but I think the point is made. The idea Israel is some European colony is a lie spread by haters seeking to delegitimise the Jewish state\n\nSo now *YOU* know not to believe the lies\n\nShabbat shalom everyone -have a great weekend!</li>
<li>@realDonaldTrump No, they‚Äôre losing jobs because YOU unleashed a deadly pandemic on America, one the U.S. warned Israel about in NOVEMBER and you were calling a hoex in MARCH, you lying, racist, grim reaping, son of a klansman. https://t.co/2G8dMf6zd2</li>
<li>@yoda This is going to happen a lot. The doses expire pretty quickly at room temperature and need to be thrown out if not used in time, so it's better to find a random person to inject rather than throw them out. Here in Israel they grabbed a pizza delivery guy off the street.</li>
