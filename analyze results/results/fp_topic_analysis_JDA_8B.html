<li>@Rachael_Swindon @knightrgb I agree however there are many people who say it is antisemetic to challenge the Israeli government at all,its a word used to often now by people who don‚Äôt understand it.

<li>Unbelievable. At Tower Hamlets. Once again anti-Israel Corbynites are attacking the definition of #antisemitism. They just want the right to hate Jews and are unhappy the council disagree with them. Expect trouble this evening. https://t.co/00sd3fxfJb</li>

<li>You don't get to label anyone critical of Israel and the weaponisation of antisemitism as "a crank" and label the evidenceless claims of former Guido employees as "something to be taken seriously" and then be angry RLB took the only stance that wouldn't lead to mass condemnation</li>
<li>The boycott movement (#BDS) against Israel is so obviously rooted in antisemitism. \n\nIt is telling that nations such as Germany and Austria - who know exactly what antisemitic boycotts look like - wont tolerate it at all. \n\nThey know what it is and where it leads.</li>
