<li>@Rachael_Swindon @knightrgb I agree however there are many people who say it is antisemetic to challenge the Israeli government at all,its a word used to often now by people who don‚Äôt understand it. It‚Äôs antisemetic to challenge the existence of the Jewish community and it‚Äôs people not a governments action</li>
<li>@mmucca @OctoberFerguson @ReverendWarnock @ossoff @senatemajldr Warnock said Israeli soldiers kill Palestinians "like birds of prey" (a vicious lie), praised Farrakhan, signed hateful letter against Israel, praised another antisemite Rev. Wright.  And now we hear from his wife that he abused her. Warnock should be defeated.</li>
<li>For african christians Israel is their source of God's words. China is their source of products, France/UK is for their education, Canada is their refugee camp, USA is their source of income, Dubai is their look alike paradise. Heaven is their home.</li>
<li>Is @hkpoliceforce officer Tam Yu-hei really that stupid? 1st the Nazi propaganda film compared Jews to rats. Then SS stormtroopers were rounding up Jews for Hitler's concentration camps to be terminated. Were Nazi propagandists calling Jews rats also is a term of endearment? https://t.co/MDxGg2EQAK</li>

<li>Protection is very needed by all in these times especially the children of Israel. Satan is lurking at an all time high for the Righteous especially because most of the world has turned to a reprobated mind which means their souls are already his to say the VERY LEAST. https://t.co/suDPk8XnE8</li>

<li>@RealMattCouch Islamic Philosophy Hates Christians And Jews !üî•üëø</li>
<li>The Holocaust was legal. Slavery was legal. Segregation was legal.\n\nPeople who hid Jews in their homes were criminalized. People who freed slaves were criminalized. People who stood up for equality &amp; justice were vilified and criminalized. \n\nLegality is not a guide for morality!</li>
<li>@Mediaite @thanerosenbaum Congratulations, Sir. You are right on target.  Jews should beware of the virulent Jew-hating nationalism of Corby and so many Islamicists.   Their hatred is as deep  as anything to be found in Germany in the 1920's and 1930's.  Many publically or privately favor a Final Solution</li>

<li>@DopeyNortherner @dorset_eye The BOD‚Äôs 10 wishes mentions Palestine once. ‚ÄúA secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state‚Äù.\n\nWhat part of that do you have an issue with?\n\nThe rest talks about security of British Jews.

<li>You don't get to label anyone critical of Israel and the weaponisation of antisemitism as "a crank" and label the evidenceless claims of former Guido employees as "something to be taken seriously" and then be angry RLB took the only stance that wouldn't lead to mass condemnation</li>
<li>It‚Äôs insane how the news of Israel bombing Gaza barely makes it to the newspapers. It‚Äôs so normalized and Palestinian lives are so dehumanized by the West that they don‚Äôt even believe it‚Äôs relevant news. https://t.co/ZxBkQ6xmPx</li>

<li>@CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump The Alt Right plans on banishing Jews of America to Israel, when in their sick, delusional minds they assume power behind an aspiring despot like Trump or Hawley.\nThey interpret Zionism as facilitating that objective.\nIn reserve, they fantasize about concentration camps.</li>
<li>Paul Nehlen is a white supremacist, hates Blacks, Jews, &amp; non whites, wore a tshirt with face of #TreeOfLifeSynagogue murderer &amp; says he‚Äôs a hero. He wants a race war.

<li>Trump‚Äôs now saying saying AOC +3 are anti-Israel. Just fyi, his pet name for Kusher was ‚ÄòThe Jew‚Äô at ‚ÄòCelebrity Apprentice‚Äô not a joke fyi. @realDonaldTrump</li>
<li>Trump gets a peace deal done between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and he didn‚Äôt even have to send $150 billion to the worlds leading sponsor of terror to make it happen. \n\nMakes you wonder what these other clowns in government have been doing for the past few decades.</li>
<li>I regret having read the Torah now. The whole thing‚Äôs a shanda! I had no idea the whole thing was full of stuff about Israel &amp; that the biggest Zionist of the lot was God himself! As a woke rabbi I think my congregation may have to consider adding God to our BDS list. Oy!</li>
<li>@apocalypseos @Snarkathon @JoeBiden @TulsiGabbard @SenKamalaHarris @truthout Agreed. BTW, Israel knew this and supported Nuland's efforts--she's married to a Jewish Zionist herself.</li>
